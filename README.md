# Twokinds-wordcount
I tried to find the number of words present in the webcomic twokinds

I tried two different methods:

Method 1 is a python-based, very slow method, which gives less accurate results overall. It's based on another project by damishshah.

Method 2 is a swift-based, much faster methods, resulting in a more accurate output.

Method 3 is a web scraper that collects the official transcripts directly from the twokinds website, if no transcript is available, it substitues in method 2's results instead
