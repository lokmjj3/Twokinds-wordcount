0083.jpg

0084.jpg
euchre?!     greetings, flora.     flora? what's wrong?     it's been quite a while,     hasn't it? amazing, of all the     places, we meet up here.     it's... been so long...     e-euchre... i've missed     you so much!     but why are you     in that cage?     so, how have you been     since the escape?     4     oh. this? funny     and these generous     but they were very insistent.     story, actually...     humans offered me a lift.     i was out for a morning     i politely refused...     walk the other day.

0085.jpg
b-but euchre!     this is horrible!     splendid idea!     i can't stand to see     you in chains again! i have     to get you out of here!     i was just thinking     about leaving, myself!     have to say, of all the     people i've met, you're the one i've     always hoped to see again.     i'd be honored to     travel with you.     there is one     problem, though.     you see, i've already     been sold, and apparently it's     so even if you were     to someone of royalty.     a human, you still wouldn't     be able to buy me.     i'd imagine the only one     capable of getting me out now would     be the grand templar himself!

0086.jpg

0126.jpg
the feral keidran...     when a normal keidran     experiences a lot of mental     after about a day,     trauma, sometimes...     becomes impossible.     their minds will shut down,     and they revert back to their     4     primitive selves.     occationally, they will     snap out of it, but...     they become just like     well, you don't have     any other animal, relying     to worry, flora. not while     only on their instincts.     i'm here to help you.     it's something i've always     feared.. become a feral.     oh, the humping thing?     by the way... i was     kinda wondering, why did     that.. feral.. you know...     that wasn't cause     she was a feral.     it's something that     happens to all us female     keidran now and then.

0127.jpg

we finally managed to find     our way out of the forest.     this city had an even larger tower• and there was something     strange about it... the town seemed to appear out of no where.     but we didn't complain...     i anan     (7>     *a w     keith was still a little unhappy,     but he was coming around.     it seems flora and him had made up     and were getting along better now.     how are you     holding up, flora?     fine!)     oookay, i     you say so.     unfortunately.     flora was four days into her heat, and     with no relief, she was little on edge.

this is over.     arg!     even if you can admit     you love her, she will never     hear it while i'm here.     and that's all     that matters.     my mission is done.     i will bring flora back to her     home, and seal her memories,     just as i did with yours.     this can't be the     end, can it?     flora's memories..     have failed?     was it all     for.. nothing?     no, wait! you can't!     n     s     trace, what are you doing?     stop her!     what? who is...     bonk!     you're not gunna take that,     are you? it took me forever     to get this stuff set up!     wanna see blood-shed!     do     karen, can't you be serious     for once in your life?

0170.jpg
seriously, trace.     i don't know what's     going on, entirely, but you     have to do something!     but i can't...     ma•     i can't risk hurting     flora! i can barely move     in any case...     maybe you just     need a little help?     it's you! uh.. euchre?     what?!     but... what about flora?     you're practically     her brother!     i'm honored you     remember me.     must say, i have to     agree with this human.     are you saying you     would fight her too?     me? heck, no!     listen trace, it's true that     i'd be killed!     the masks know everything.     past, present, and future.     but there's one thing     that they cannot predict...     how does he know     who is this keidran?     so much about us?

0171.jpg
erg..     you stay out of this!     crash!     die, you mortal kei-wait...!     what?!     heheheh, looks like     where did you...     you're a little too slow.     trace, listen to me.     you cannot be afraid     of the power you have.     you control your powers,     you cannot allow them to     control you any more.     you can do great thing.     and horrible things. it's all     up to you, trace.     but you have to act.     you must fight! i can-     not fight her for you.     h-how dare you-l     ack!     catch!     fight her, trace.     get flora back!

0172.jpg
heheh... very inspiring... euchre.     …for real     did you think     this time?!     so too, boy?     wha-?     are you ready     to fight me...     crap, crap!     what do i do?     trace? trace??     aaaaaaaaghi     what if i hurt her..     what if.. then i.. what..     just...     attack!     huff... those..     oh, wait...     those pieces..     d-did i win?     crap, i'm screwed.

0173.jpg
i wouldn't try that     bit after bit...     she slowly tums into an     again if i were you.     empty shell of a keidran...     you know, the reason we     need our hosts is because     we feed on their energy.     and every time you attack     oh well...     me, you force me to use up a     little bit more of flora.     maybe that's better     for her after all...     if only i could help...     ..interfere...     but there's nothing     can do... am bound     by the rules...     hm... she has a stronger     hold on flora then had though.     don't worry...     i believe i've done enough     nama     interfering for the both of us.     but... i'm sure     everything will turn out     alright in the end.

0174.jpg
how are things     how does it feel, trace?     progressing?     not favorably, i'm afraid.     ephemural is once again     trying to awaken trace's true self,     and it seems to be working.     to be helpless? weak?     unable to do anything?     how does it feel, to know     this doesn't look good...     you were able to kill hundreds     of thousands of people...     ch     the ground..     it's... moving...     and yet...     trace, please, don't listen!     ...even when that person...     ...is just...     you are unable to save     the life of one person...     ...a keidran...

0175.jpg
is it already     too late?     i do not sense that trace     has regained his memories...     however, this is also something     have never seen before...     no...     i believe trace is in a transition.     he still doesn't     remember anything...     and yet he's now     discovered his power...     i fear that it is     corrupting his mind.     heheh..     i... i had never     imagined power could     feel this good...     this.. this isn't     supposed to happen!     what good will those     powers do you anyway?     you can't hurt me     without going through     flora first!     heh, i don't need anything     else except these powers...     why should i care about flora?

0176.jpg
don't understand it.     you have to realize that trace     this is insane. you     hasn't been able to do anything to     have to do something.     help flora up until this point.     now that he has power,     if trace doesn't remember,     though, he's lost sight of why he     then why doesn't he care about     wanted them to begin with.     the safety of flora anymore?     all he wants is     to kill ephemural.     you know i can't     doing anything. i am     don't you get it, euchre?     not to interfere-     that's flora out there,     your sister - practically.     maybe trace isn't the     you and your rules!     only one who's let power     get to his head...     i did not make     the rules...     trace is the one that     must get flora back...     but i can point him     in the right direction.     hey! what the     heck is this?     sigh, you are right.     perhaps i have been worrying     too much about these rules.     will interfere... once..     what the-?

0177.jpg
trace, you've forgotten...     wha... what the-!     it's gone!     flora! and the     and we're.. in the forest?     mask, it's...     forgotten..     hey, what're     you doing?     wow m     where am     how are you     doing this?!     grrrrr.....     what's wrong     gasp!     with you? why are you     what's wrong with     growling like that?     how did you know my name?     my powers? how can     he be stronger?     forgotten.     what was that, a vision?     and i didn't forget! i remember     come on, flora!     when that happened!     it's when i first     trace...     hey... wait!     met her, so what?     die, keidran!     keith, stop it!     eh.. hey, where did     ...about...     she's not the     they go.. not another one..     ...flora...?     enemy..     what the-!?     what are you, euchre? why     are you showing me these things!     there's nothing wrong with my     memories! i haven't forgotten-     trace...?

0178.jpg
i... i can't believe     the whole point of     i remember     i thought about letting     me being here is for her...     this too, i think...     flora die...     flora...     the power... it     overwhelmed me...     what happened?     how could i forget?     trace... i.. um..     it's... our first...     ahah! i see     you've chosen to     break the rules.     but you know full well     what a noble sacrifice...     the consequences...     ..for such a petty cause.     i hate having to strike     you down while you are     mrraaaahhhh!     defenceless, however..     i have risked too much     already. once you are out     of the way...     shall depart... with     this little keidran...     flora! what's wrong?     wha- what's going on?     sister.

0179.jpg

0189.jpg
i always loved     this old place.     do you remember     we used to... come here     any of this?     all the time... to your cabin     in out here in the woods.     that was of course... before     you became... power hungry.     we even came here when the     border got close... when it became dan-     gerous because of the keidran.     0     no... please, this isn't     ..no, i can't     ...good. i think it's     someplace you'd want to...     say i do... sorry.     for the best that you     to remember at all.     do not remember.     what? why? want to     know about my past.     but there is     something i must...     must tell you.     trace, am..     ...i'm not your wife.     i'm sorry, trace... for all     the lies i had to tell you.     we did know each     other... a long time ago...     i came back because of     buh?     neutral. she brought me here.     i had no choice, but... i had     to see you. i'm sorry.

0190.jpg
for a while.. i'd     thought you'd never     be happy again.     trace, seeing you in this     brief moment in time...     ...has brought me greater     happiness then i fear you will     ever understand.     but seeing you     with that girl...     i hope you will forgive     me someday, trace.     .i am glad you've found     someone that can make you     smile once more.     even if she is...     a keidran.     i just.. couldn't bear...     couldn't bear to burden you...     legacy     449 - 477     with the memory     of my passing...

trace is alive.     grand templar     knee and tried to kill him. the     ouncil is not happy     yes, f heard the news     he was tacated only a few miles     from the keldran border. what does     the council plan to do?     dragons?     they can't     be serious!     sending a dragon     as you know trace     near keidran territory.     is needed in arder to finish     the final tower.     it could be     considered an     the opunal knows that they must     act of war!     find trace as quickly as poss tile.     should trace dle,     fad his way into the claws     of the keidran... would be disastrous     this is why we've chosen     employ.. the dragons.     not to mention the     fact that the king would     that won't be a problem     never approve it.     for long, sirvitine.     he wouldn't     once we have trace     allow us templar that     in our hands and the final     kind of gold.     tower completed...     you know what     the king wil     the dragons ask for.     bow down to l8.     d

0192.jpg
saria told me we were     do you even know     right here, near the border..     what you're doing?     and only about 15 miles     away from the port.     trace, come back with us to     the templar. we can helpl     trace, listen to reason.     i'm not going back!     and what's that, trace?     at least not yet.     i have other things     helping these.. animals?     have to do.     they aren't animals!     listen to me, trace. you     don't have any place to go!     we're dangerously close     to the keidran! you can't keep     wandering out here.     i can't go back to     the templar either!     trace... if you're going     hey, who's side     (o go, you'd better go now.     nevermind. maren, get     karen. we have to go too.     are you on here?     the templar will     the council is     and why would     calling all templar back     the council do some-     think to look here.     to the stronghold.     thing like that?     after all, you used to     live here.. before...     what...?     they've never called     all of you back before.

0193.jpg
trace, i think     well, you're certainly     you should go.     being unusually insightful     after everything you've     all of the sudden.     been through... i think you need     some time for yourself.     yeah, i know.     well, what are friends     for, anyway?     ever since four years ago,     you've been kinda obsessed     friends? hah! he probably     about the templar.     doesn't even know your name.     trace, good luck on your journey.     hey, i packed all the     you've surprised me,     supplies i could find, trace.     trace. so much change...     even in four years.     it's not much though.     i'm sure it'll be okay, keith.     can't forgive you for what     it's only 15 miles. should only     you did to me, but thank you for     take one night to get there. we'll be     if you     saving me from neutral.     um... no problem.     in the port by morning.     say so.     now all that's left...     flora, you     where's flora?     .....home..     in there?     she went back up     to your room, i think.     i'll get her.     oh! i'll be right     down, keith.     finally we were on our way again. out of     the old house, and into the keidran forest.

after a few hours...     think we should     just set up camp now.     we'll get there     in the morning.     it's getting pretty dark.     this looks like a     i'll get some     nice little clearing.     flora, could you     set up the lantem?     wood for a fire.     as long as we follow     the stream, we shouldn't get     disoriented tomorrow.     oh, could     you also get some     trace... i don't think we     should camp out here.     keidran have been here...     fresh water?     i can smell their scent.     think we're out.     trace...?     huh? what's     wrong, flora?

0196.jpg
flora, trust me.     ...yeah, i suppose.     trace, where did this     it'll be fine.     the scent was     book come from?     kinda old, anyway.     rat.     you and i have been through     a lot in the last few days.     i'm sure we'll     let's just get some rest.     be fine for one     night... hm?     hey, wait!     huh..? you don't...?     well, um.. don't worry     can explain that...     about this old thing.     tiniest clact     it's just an old     on an eternall     karen     story book.     oh, it is?     what does it say?     i... can't read.     i was never taught     as a slave.     yes. found it at the house. nothing     don't worry about me.     you'd be interested in, i'm sure.     this is my territory.     well. i'd better continue     setting up camp.     §l     okay... do you mind     if i go for a walk?     i guess if you really     want to.. but be careful.     flora, you said it yourself...     i'll drag you back by the tail if     it's dangerous out there.     you get me worried about you.

0197.jpg
i can smell... lots     of scents here... one     maybe there's     wait.. what     some more over...     am i doing?     familiar... but...     no, none here.     ...none of them     are recent...     i should be happy i'm     not finding anything...     more keidran is the     last thing we need.     sigh...     i'm happy with trace.     meanwhile, in the trees...     why would i want     to put that at risk?     <flora... you've been     a slave to the humans for     why do i want     too long, my dear.>     to go home?     is it just because     'm a keidran?     <not used to these     feelings, are you?>     without the power from those     templar buildings, your instincts are     slowly becoming unsuppressed.>

get ahold of     better get out of here     yourself, flora.     before i run into a-     things have been     tough, but you can do it!     as long as i have     trace, i'm fine.     ..a keidran?     mew!     ow... sythe?     jeez, don't sneak up     on me like that.     what are you doing     out here anyway?     isn't it obvious?     i've been looking     for you, flora.     i'm here to bring     you back home.     i'm not marrying you.     have you forgotten     that we are engaged?     come on, take     my hand.     it's an arranged marriage.     neither of us     have a choice.

0199.jpg
don't care what all those     didn't want to be     old grey-furs arranged for us.     your enemy, flora. i still     neither of us really have     care about you...     feelings for each other.     but.. i can't risk my     i want to lead my own     own life by coming back     life. it might be foolish, but     empty handed.     it's my own decision.     sigh... fine, go then.     will bring you back, as     i'll tell them i... couldn't     ordered, but i can't do it alone.     find you or something.     at the camp...     huh, oh, hey flora.     ah, okay.     you're back sooner     -sigh- i'm just exhausted.     trace, i'm back!     then i expected.     it seems like all we     do is travel around.     yeah, i... got tired.     i saw some blue light     while i was coming back...     was that you, trace?     after all this is over...     i just want to go back home     uh, blue light? no...     and settle down.     i... um... i have no idea.     yeah. i wouldn't mind     well, i haven't actually     doing that myself.     up your tent yet. and i'm     y-you mean.. you     but we'll have to go     kinda tired myself.     don't mind if i sleep in your     tent with you...?     our separate ways when     that happens.     so, was thinking...     yeah... i know..     i think i'm going     to go to bed. is that my     tent over there?     actually, that's keith's.     oh.. but... then where     am supposed to sleep?     if you wanted to...     you could always...

0203.jpg
flora?     hrmph... flora...     ...huh, flora?     hm....     over here, trace.     well, i just wanted to     open up the tent and get     good morning!     some fresh air.     unfortunately, the ground     was all wet. my feet got pretty     muddy walking around.     i must have rained while     we were asleep. and looking at the     clouds, i think it might again.     oh, there you are.     good morning.     what are you     doing up?     rain, huh?     though, i don't want to     well, i don't really     yup, i guess so!     add any more scratches.     feel like walking around     when it's all wet.     and i don't know about you,     but i think i can come up with some-     thing to do o pass the time..     so i guess we're stuck     i don't mind,     in this tent for a while.     really!

0204.jpg
you've fallen apart.     just like your little race.     it was a bold move, altering     the mind of my warrior.     you knew if you killed him,     more would just take his place.     welcome back,     ephemural.     it's been a while     since you've come     instead you had him fall for     to this realm.     the enemy. now that's clever.     one by one,     unfortunately, that little     the clans will fall.     keidran fell in love as well.     until only my race     when the time came, you     shall rule this earth.     couldn't split them up.     now, without flora, the tiger     and wolf clans have no alliance.     already, the wolves have chosen     not to join the others, so sure that they     can defend themselves.     he may be speaking     the truth. the outcome lies     have no choice. i must ensure at     on the mortals now.     least some keidran blood survives.     my powers are weakened. i     from this point forth...     cannot risk attempting to enter the     world again for some time.     but perhaps there is something     can do... there is another race...     one that i have not allowed     for many, many years.

0205.jpg
flora, you asleep?     ...flora, do you     think what we're     doing is wrong?     no, just     mmm, five     resting.     more minutes.     i think we should     probably start getting     dressed soon.     there's nothing     it's the middle     wrong with sleeping     of the day.     in once in a while.     no, not just that, flora.     flora, you know     this whole relationship. it's just     what i mean.     the sex?     not... you know, normal.     what if it just     doesn't work out?     trace, i knew     what was getting into     when i chose you.     but where will we live?     trace, are you     trace, i know... we'll have     and what about children?     saying you don't want     to think about it eventually.     me anymore?     we'll never be able to     but for right now, i'd rather     just lie here with you.     experience parenthood.     what? no, no!     there's so much     didn't mean that...     we'll miss!     everything else     will work itself out.

0206.jpg
meanwhile...     <nephew, you know i have     ‹you sent assassins     never liked this arrangement with the     to kill flora too? why!?>     tigers. we wolves don't need help.>     <so. we have decided to take this     opportunity to break off from them.>     <the tigers believe the girl to be     <there's no need to     lost. they will not miss her.>     shout. i may be old, but     my hearing is fine.>     <a-are you mad? the     humans would destroy us     without the tiger's aid!>     <you impudent youth! i     will not have you questioning me!     be quiet and know your place.>     <and why do you seem     <damn it, he's been     sitting there all day!>     <patience, brother.>     concerned about the girl?>     <i told you, he's a basitin.     <you always said you     <the targets have been     military people. they don't get     didn't like her anyway.>     in their tent for hours!>     tired like we do.>     <.. yeah... i did     say that...>     <why doesn't he     <if we try to kill him here, it     go in his?>     might attract the others. we can't     risk being outnumbered.>     <but, there's always a weakness.>     keith?     l-laura?     <we need to lure him away     from the camp. i'm sure a little...     keith...?     persuasion will do the trick.>     huh?

throughout my travels, i've heard     a lot of things said about the basitin.     most of them weren't too flattering.     but after the battle in the forest,     three things i knew were certain.     one...     basitin are tough. they can endure physical     pain that could easily kill most other people.     i've always found it remarkable,     considering their small size.     two, they are stubborn. or     thickheaded, as like to say.     oh, they also seem to have a     bit of a temper when aggrivated.     and probably most important of all, three: either by a gift from     the gods or simply from thousands of years of living on an island     full of deadly toxins, basitin are, in fact, immune to most poisons.

0216.jpg
hey, hold on     a minute!     graaahh!     ah!     ooof!     jeez, when they     mentioned the girl, never     imagined her like this!     wait, listen...     listen to me!     if you go through     with the marriage as planned,     we don't     there's nothing our leader     have to fight!     can do to stop it.     come with     us willingly!     will not marry     sythe! i'm not going     we were hired     anywhere with you!     to kill you, yes.     but... but! we also support     the merging of our clans.     we don't believe the keidran can     you selfish girl!     stand up to the humans without it!     think of your people!     we'll deal with     for now... sleepl     her later.     nya~!     oh, for goodness     sake, we don't have time     for this, zen!

0217.jpg
n-no, i... can't...     won't...     shouldn't she have     fallen asleep by now?     she's resisting the spell!     she has a stronger will then     thought. you'll have to take care     of her the old fashioned way.     i've got to finish off trace.     kill her?     but natani...     save it, zen.     i know how you feel     about the alliance of the clans,     and you know we     but let's face it...     really need this job.     so just pick up your     it's not our job to     sword and finish her so we     question things. it's our     can get out of here.     job to kill things.     sigh... alright.     but as much as |     i'm sorry about this,     hate it. natani is right.     girl. i really am.     we keidran are strong. we will     survive against the humans.     i will be sure to pray for your     spirit's release from this world.     n-nyeh..

0218.jpg
now hurry     up and take care     of her while i finish     this one.     i've waited a long     time for this, trace.     this is for all of my     people- my family that you     murdered in cold blood.     flora... flora!     listen to me.     i'm not going to kill you.     i'm just going to make it look     like i've killed you.     n-nya?     listen, i know     that spell is making     you weak.     just be sure to lie still.     i became an assassin     to fight humans, but i cannot     kill someone like this.     this has to work.     flora must survive.     w-what about     trace...     it's too late for     him. natani is about     to finish him off.     prepare to diel     he's just a     gah!     human anyway.

0219.jpg
g-graah!     what... zen?     zenl     you selfish child!     think of your people!     grah.. nlah!     i'm not going to kill you.     i believe that without you,     our race may die out!     no.. this is wrong.     my people...

journal entry, may 9th, 477     unlike keidran, who must use mana stored in stones...     mana is the basis of     all magic in this world.     grraah!     templar have the unique ability to draw mana directly from the earth.     ugh...     however, once all the mana from one location is drained without time     to replenish, it is the earth's life-energy that begins to be drawn out.     this is also known     as black mana...     for there is always a consequence.     ‹teleport!>     it is a very power energy...     augh..!     what the...?     but most refuse to use it.     you...     need more..     more mana...     ‹how dare you harm     my older brother. you'll pay     for that, basitin.>     <i took out the great     trace legacy. i don't think     you'll be much of a...>     ....what is this? why...     is the grass dying?.>     from what i've seen, taking life-energy from the earth often causes nervousness, violence,     delusions, loss of memory, insanity and sometimes death. it worsens the more it's used. i must     be careful how much i use, i can already feel some of these effects taking hold on me....     i'm taking saria to our house near the border     this afternoon. she always loves down there.

0221.jpg
ah...!     you again!     don't you people     ever stay down?!     this is bad... they're     both weakened, but with three     against one...     it... it looks     just like the magic...     it's happening     the magic of crystals     again! but..     formed from dying earth...     it's stronger     this time!     what... kind of     but that magic's     magic is this?     forbidden!     it destroys the mind!     this isn't good..     w-what is that?!     do     he... he's     summoned a...!

man, everyday is     the same thing...     i get up, work,     and i go to bed.     it's so boring... i feel like the     character in a storybook that only     shrcki     shows up in one scene,     doesn't have a name,     and is only used as : literary     device in order to momentarily break-     this sucks...     away from the action.     why can't something     exciting happen to me for     once in my life!     in fact, i wouldn't be surprised     there's a group of people some-     where out there right now fighting a...     dragon or something.     while i'm stuck here     working in order to show another     angle of the story.     bzzzat!     gah!     woah, what the     storm clouds?     heck was that...     but what's that     moving in them?

0223.jpg
ah, there you are,     my dear trace...     a man-made     into trouble as     dragon...     always, see.     how cute...     trace, come on!     snap out of it!     fight it, tracel     uh... f-flora...     before that thing     can't you hear     kills us all!     me? it's me, flora...     trace!     i'm here, trace.     i'm right here     don't let it     with you, always.     control you...     meanwhile...     gah...!     1-i just can't fight     something like that!     no amount of gold     is worth this!     i have to get     out of here...     going somewhere?

0224.jpg
i've got to do     somethi... huh?     oh no, not     again...     trace! hey, get up!     you can't pass out now!     this is bad...!     <going to finish     me, eh basitin?>     ‹then do it!>     there's no way     can win against that     demon, but...     i've still got two mana     crystals left. if i can just     get away from here...     they're going to     kill each other.     keith, stop it!     this is my fight,     the dragon! i don't     think trace is in control     flora, stay out of it.     of it anymore!     and tell trace to     back off to, i don't need     his help to fight.

0225.jpg
<didn't anyone teach     you never to take your eyes     off your opponent?!>     ignirasi     agh-!     actually no, they     didn't have to!     that's instinct!     yet

0226.jpg
i'm sure that spell of     keith, we have to     his attracted the dragon's eye.     uh...     get out of here!     can you carry trace?     of course.     what about-?     ‹that slice     hit deep.>     <forget about     ‹i'm not     him, just go!>     going to make i     out of here.>     <i guess this is     my fate...>     <not that it'd matter, i     can't concentrate long enough     <i can't seem to find     to cast a spell...>     my last crystal, could have     swom i had another...>     <at least my last hours     ended in battle...>     <come on! get     up! stop being so     <hey, i'm trying to give     melodramatic!>     my dying monologue!>     <oh please, ya     big baby. that other guy     had a sword go through     him, get up!>     ‹here it     comes...>     <i guess this     <hey- what are     is the end....>     you doing?>

0227.jpg
huff... if it wasn't for     the fact that i still need     you for my mission...     well...     i'd probably still     save your ass.     but then i wouldn't     have an excuse for it.     hm... looks like i'm     oops, think     going to have to interfere...     he noticed me.     burning the barrier of trees     between keidran and human     territories can't be good.

0229.jpg
come on,     grr... i don't need     let's go!     your help! why are you     helping me anyway?     was just trying     to kill you!     the forest...     my home, it's     burning!     there's nothing     we can do. i see the river     over here, come on!     i'm helping you     because i don't want more     people getting hurt.     your brother showed     me that even assassins     huh? where     like you are people too.     did she go?     besides, i saved     your life. you owe     me now. and want     you to help us.     feh! how do you     know i care anything     about life-debts?     think even someone     like you still follows the code.     but even if you don't, what     options do you have?

0230.jpg
rooaaaarrr!     ahhhh!     trace, what's     wrong? trace!     keith, we're here!     heheh...     flora! you- why     is he with you?!     ‹what'd he say?>     <nevermind that now.>     what's wrong with trace?     ugh...     don't know, i can't     get through to him. maybe     you should try.     he seems to be in pain.

0231.jpg
trace, what's wrong?     i... i can't see...     flora... where are you...     finally, -huff- a break.     now if only i could find     that dam crystal, i could get     out of this forest...     this wound is still bleeding...     need to hurry before those three     notice i'm still here...     ah, here it is!     i knew i had one left...     now i can... transport myself...     i do feel sorry for her. such     an odd group of people.

0232.jpg
she'll most likely     no. no! i can't be feeling     be killed out here.     sorry for them now!     not that i wasn't about     to kill her anyway.     my magic might help, but     then i'd be stuck here too!     but considering they fought     no, i'll just go home...     off both me and zen, it's a shame     they probably wont     they have to die now...     die in the fire anyway. they     could just get eaten.     yeah, that really made     me feel less guilty.     must be insane... but she     did save my life. the code says     ah! what's happening     i must do the same...     to him, keith?     -sigh- fine...     it's that keidran!     knew you shouldn't     have helped him!     will break the human's     mental link to the demon!

0233.jpg
<there, that should->     <wait, what     chuh?>     are you?>     hey! stop, i was     helping you guys!>     ‹like l     buy that!>     it! <stop it! listen to     ‹probably has something to do     me! i used my magic     to break the-:     with that lousy spell of y- woah!>     <er, why is the is     ground shaking?>     ack!     uh...

0234.jpg
trace, you're     awake!     yeah, guess. my     head hurts, though.     and i think i'm seeing things... is     that keith... on top of that guy?     oh, so it is. wow,     had no idea keith was...     ya know, "that way."     hm, and i always thought     he had a crush on me...     but i guess that     can't be possible...     hey, shut up!     i'm not... erm...     "that way!"     what?! no, it can! i do!     <| can't understand a word     er... wait... no! i don't...     they're saying, and something tells     me don't want to know...>     geh... i'm not gay!     shouldn't we still     be worried about the     dragons overhead?

0235.jpg
what a wonderful day!     where is hel?     hey get over here!     where is he?     i've finally got that whole     where is who..?     tower explosion incident under     control and back on schedule.     and i hear they're     you know who i'm talking     serving beansprout soup     about, you stupid, dress-wearing     the kitchen today!     scrivener! your master!     that fool you call the grand templar!     i... i'm not sure     m-mr. baron, sir.     think he might still     -crash-     be in his chambers.     oh . i hope this doesn't have     anything to do with lady nora.     i told master he shouldn't have     employed that dragon.     hm, i think i'll go have     some of that soup now.

0236.jpg
trace, come on!     hey, get off me...     you have to get     rid of the dragon     wha- where the     i told you, you     you summoned!     hell did that come from?     summoned it!     did i?     well... i guess if i summoned     it, i can unsummon it.     come on. let's go, get up.     trace, you sound different...

0237.jpg
trace, what are you-     what's this? i sense     need to     more magic..     concentrate!     trace's magic...     i don't really know     what i'm doing...     but if i cast that thing, i think     can take the energy back!     something's happening!     the false dragon's energy     surely trace wouldn't be foolish enough     s being drained... but where     to draw all that dark magic into himself!     is it going? surely...

0238.jpg
ngh, i-i'm not sure...     trace, what's     it feels like i've     wrong?     been bumed...     trace, i'll finish him off!     don't go overboard     like you usually do...!     um... trace, did     you... here that...?     trace... th-there's     another dragon... and i     think it just talked...

0239.jpg
it's good to see     you again, euchre.     think it's... landing...     stay behind mel     as it is to see you, old master.     please, don't call me that.     yes...     even when you and flora     aren't we all.     were on my farm, i never treated     either of you like slaves.     sorry, old habits die hard.     that was a serious wound     you had. i'm still amazed how     fast you recovered.     i'm old... i've learned to     protect myself from such things     as death. though...     all of keidran kind will     am at the end of my life,     be at its end if the final tower     one way or another.     is allowed to be completed.     clever, you templar are.     yes, i'm afraid it is.     using our own instincts     against us... a great tragedy     is approaching.

0240.jpg
it's been a long time     since i've seen you...     there, now that that's     been taken care of...     have you forgotten     about me too, trace?     i'm not here to hurt you!     gah...!     don't worry,     little one...     geh... get back!     lick~6

0241.jpg
bleh! you taste     trace...?     like a keidran.     are you okay?     smell like one too!     you look a bit pale.     trace?     what have you     been doing?     oh, so you're the     gah!     keidran i tasted...     hello, i am known     as lady nora.     ack! trace!     ah... i've gotcha.     are you okay?     neh...!     nyaaa....

0242.jpg
ugh... where am i?     gah... my mind's like sludge...     remember that dragon...     nora? wait... how     do i know that name?     neh...?     eh... can't think... ah, well...     trace!     what's this.. oh, flora.     thank goodness.     i wonder where keith is?     wha... who said that?     well, flora's here.     that's all that matters.     good, you're awake! i went     hunting, i'll be right there, little one.     i decided to transport you to     haven fields, just outside the forest.     town is just beyond that hill.

0243.jpg
meanwhile...     i've found you at last,     head councilman.     so you have.     herph, you templar are all the same.     you think your magic puts you above the law.     don't think we aren't aware of you!     have you forgotten that     dragons in the west, fires along     you still serve under the king?     the border, and war at our gates!     the templar cannot     simply take action on its     own accord as it has!     the king will certainly     n-neh... food?     see to it that you-     does it look like i want     what is this thing     food right now?     doing in here?     nya... mehbeh...?     please, don't mind her.     she hasn't been thinking     clearly since being exposed     to the tower's magic.     hmph, yes, the towers.     anyway, the king wishes     to see you immediately.

chapter 8     a peaceful retreat

0245.jpg
trace, i'm here.     take it easy     w-where are the others?     this time.     i considered eating them - i was rather     hungry, to be honest. but i assumed you want     them alive. they're just over here.     put them in the same magical sleep     as she's in right now, in order to transport     you all here one at a time.     set her down - i'd like     to speak with you about     your recent travels.     here, flora. rest.     you're a different person     then you used to be, trace.     i've never seen you so gentle with     a keidran... she is your mate?     mate!? eh, no. of course not!     and well...     what would give     i... may have taken a quick     you that idea...     peek into your mind...     what?!     you saw...?     well, for one thing, you're     not on purpose!     practically covered in her scent.     though, it was quite     interesting..

0246.jpg
relax, trace.     it matters little to me who     you choose to be with.     find it humorous how devoted     that thing is to you, however.     one look into her mind and it's     obvious her attraction to you.     no, what concerns me is the     relationship itself. what do you plan to do     after this little adventure is over?     a having a keidran for a wife     wouldn't look good, you know?     wife? oh, no...     marriage is... um..     wasn't planning on that.     is that so?     you could always go back to     templar... you could keep her     as a slave, if you wanted.     n-no... i couldn't do that     to flora. she told me about her     childhood and growing up.     she wouldn't stand     for it, i'm sure.     i'm don't know what we're going to     do. i really care about flora, but...     a human and a beast... well, trace,     there is one place you could go...     the more i think about it... the more i     the orchard valley.     realize there's really no place for us.

0247.jpg
what is the "orchard valley"?     no, it's not a town. it's a place.     some... town?     it's hidden far off, beyond     the basitin islands, on the other     side of the continent.     it is a place beyond even the     influence of the templar.     the village itself is called lyn knoll. ugly     word, but it's a combination of two languages.     i do not think the templar are even     aware of it's existence.     but if they are, they don't seem     to be taking actions against it.     in the village, members of all three     races coexist... relatively in peace.     not so many basitins, of course.     they have that stubborn pride.     i only know of the village because i had     happened across it on one of my flights.     they've paid me quite well to keep     their secret to myself, and make sure     no one but the right people find it.     but if you are looking for place to get     away from it all, that would be where to go.     simply travel beyond the shores of     the basitin islands, once you're done there,     and you'll reach the orchard valley.

0248.jpg
trace, i wish i could     stay and help you, but i'm     needed elsewhere.     remember what i've told you.     there is still much you need to know.     for now, i take my leave. i've released your...     bestial companions from their sleep.     neh...     goodbye, trace!     ah! trace!     the dragon, where...?     eh.. goodbye,     trace!?     i guess.     flora, relax, i'm     trace, you're okay!!     right here.     blarg!     the dragon's gone     now, it's safe.     /o     trace...

0249.jpg
yeah, i was almost beginning to     miss the feeling of being crushed.     come on, get up, we've got     to find keith and get going.     want to get into town     and find a boat before dark.     heh, it's been     a while since i've     sounds good! i'd rather not     done that...     stay overnight in a human city again.     amanhhht     what the heck was that?     sounded like it was...     keith?     meanwhile, nearby...     hm... i just realized i forgot to     hey, get off me!     check if those other two were a couple     jeez, wake up! don't     before i set them down...     rub against me like that!     1 eatin     heale     2     ...oh well... i'm sure     they'll sort it out.

0250.jpg
zzz.... s'nah..     woof?     later...     i've asked him, trace. he says he     was sent by the wolf king to kill us.     but.. the contract is off.     how does he know that?     <zen and i are linked mentally. i     see and feel what he does.>     <ever since he was stabbed, have     been using my energy to keep him alive.     he's now in the care of our healers.>     <without his aid, i'm not much     of a fighter. my viciousness comes     from his side of the link...>     <zen is safe for now... but since we've     failed, the king is going to banish us both. or     least me... zen is safe until he's healed..>     <so... you don't have     anywhere to go?>     you could     come with us...     huh? with you guys?

0251.jpg
‹no... no, i'm     going back. i'll face     my banishment.>     <but.. we can.. um...>     <do you have     a death wish?>     <w-wah?>     <listen, i just told you l     was sent to kill you guys.     <i.. i dunno.>     i'm a killer, obviously.     < 've just.. always believed that     everyone has some good in them.>     and so is trace, now     that think about it.     sure, you're protected     from me, because you saved     my life, the code, bah..>     <but there's nothing     stopping me from killing that human     or that.. other guy in their sleep.>     ‹what makes you think you can     just trust me all of the sudden?>     ‹you're a fool     if you think that.>     i can't understand a     word they're saying.     <4›     oh, flora's trying to get     us in killed in our sleep.     what?!

0252.jpg
<good luck, natani.>     <good bye, flora.>     <tell trace to watch     his back from now on.>     feh, more like     good riddance.     <now why did you do that, natani?     you were supposed to go with them.     they were about to trust you.>     con shut it, zen. i don't care     what the king's offered, i'm not wasting     my time on some crazy adventure.>     <aw crap, what are humans     hey, there's a keidran!     doing way out here? they must be     bet it has something to do     scouting out the fires.>     with this! skin i alive!     <i'm injured and have no weapons.     o there's sure to be more humans in the     forest.. well, guess i'll go around.>     <i've changed my mind!>     <i'll waste my time on     your crazy adventure!>

0253.jpg
hey, these keidran     belong to me.     oh, sorry, we     didn't realize.     you should really have     them collared, and stay with     them at all time.     we're close to the     border, you know?     hey, wait a minute!     i've seen this guy before!     wanted     he's the one on the wanted     posters set up two days ago!     that templar who     went crazy!     500,000 gold     runaway templar trace     buh?     legacy. blue hair, blue     eyes. no memory - harmices     hey!     anted     and that's the keidran     3.000 ga     on the other ones!     7 bla     flat-chested!?     tito a tigen     own hair, flat     -803     oh, for goodness sake,     maybe we should     not another fight already!     (2) &     try getting away?     might be a good     idea this time.

0254.jpg
"get away"?     not a chance!     gra-ah?!     that gold is mine, you     'flat chested' keidran!     you'll pay for     that, human!     smash!     well, i feel better. now     lets get out of here!     flora, remind me     never to joke about that     particular subject.

0255.jpg
we've finally made it.     ...for real, this time.     i don't like the looks     of that tower, though.     464     48     let's spend as little     time as possible, trace.     bad things always seem     to happen to us when we're     in these human cities.     that's the least of our     problems! how do you guys     expect to get to a ship?     ...is that a firework...?     you're both wanted     by the humans.     and traveling group of 'animals'     and a guy with blue hair isn't exactly what     i would call "inconspicuous."     unless there's some huge distraction,     don't see how we're getting in.

greetings, citizens!     as you can tell, i am     not guild master tarron.     he has suddenly fallen...     today marks the 171st annual     ill, and wont be joining us.     festival of the beasts.     will be taking his place.     my name is edmund     sirus templar viii.     it has been over three hundred years     since our ancestors first met and feasted with the     keidran, right here in this very in village.     and though the rest of the nation would     rather forget this event, we embrace it.     for tonight, we welcome our bestial     brethren to join us once again, and for one night     only, in our joyous celebration and feast!     let the festivities begin!

<this is     really odd...>     < do you know what's going on?>     <well sorta. it's the     "festival of beasts."     haven't you heard     of the old stories?>     <it's said that over 300 years ago,     the humans came here on     ship.>     < the humans were naturally idiots     and couldn't tell food from their own dogs,     so they began to die the first winter.>     <we generously gave the     wa     strange creatures our own food.>     ‹after a while, it became a tradition,     even after tension began to build between     our two people. that is...>     <until trace came to power four     years ago and screwed it up.>     <we haven't had a festival in     four years. what i find odd is that     it's started up again now...>     <the human's guild master, appointed     by trace himself, put a stop to them, much     to the disappointment of both sides..>     < don't see how they're getting     away with it this year, unless... guild master     tarron is no longer in command.>

wow, everything's     so colorful!     i don't think we'll be noticed     if we're quick. just blend in with the     crowd and head to the docks.     i still don't like this...     that guy said there were     wanted posters put up...     but i haven't seen     a single one...     <hey, watch out.>     <some idiot's burning     subleflower incense.>     <you know...     <don't breathe     you're pretty...>     100 deeply.>     <oh perfect, too late.:     ‹...you shouldn't be     <get a hold of yourself, we     so hard on yourself...>     don't have time for this.>     ‹and i'm not pretty!>     <oh no, not you too!>

0260.jpg
flora, we're trying not     oh, relax, trace.     to attract attention!     just look around!     you being naked     isn't going to help!     nearly all the keidran     here are either naked or     getting there now.     in fact, i think you're     making us look suspicious!     exactly!     let's see what     you have under those     robes, mr. wolf!     <hey, stop! i can barely     flora, don't-! oh,     control myself as it is!>     what's the use...     ya see, flora?     this is the attention     we didn't want!     excuse me... that's     quite an exotic keidran     you've got there.     might i inquire     where you obtained     such     creature?     er, sorry...

0261.jpg
would you and your     keidran consider joining     me for a drink?     i'd love to learn how     you acquired such a     variety of keidran.     er, no, sorry. we     really can't. we've got     to get to the docks.     flora, leave     natani alone!     <stop! hey, don't     tear the robes!>     looks to me like     you wont be getting     there very fast.     trust me, a few minutes     out of the scented air will do     them some real good.     and maybe i can help     you get to the docks.     oh, alright...     keith? hello…..?     but just for a minute,     then we've gotta go.     ca     keith, come on. give     me a hand at breaking     those two up.     flora.. tail up...

0262.jpg
come on, flora...     hey, hey!     oh, trace!     sorry, i don't     know what came     over me...     no nuzzling!     <well, that was     certainly interesting.>     <nothing like being     molested by a horny tiger.>     <that was really close,     too. i gotta control myself.>     <if she had gotten my robes     off in front of everyone...>     <hey, you, uh...     <no. no, i'm finel>     need a hand,     or.. something?>     < don't need     your help!>     ‹..and i don't need     more temptation...>     ‹come on, let's gol>

0263.jpg
here we are!     those keidran should feel     better almost instantly.     a little better, guess..     i'm sorry | couldn't     how do you feel, flora?     control myself... it was like     my head was in a fog...     oh, you speak very well! great!     sure wish had a keidran like     you in my.. eh... collection...     i'd love to learn more     about you and your history...     arie     well... i'm nothing     special, really...     true, you'd be better if you were a     bit more shapely and well-endowed...     nyal!     now that would be     the perfect keidran...!

0264.jpg
so, we're inside.     ah, yes, the     basidian islands.     we appreciate the help,     but we're in a hurry. we need     don't see too many of     to get to my island.     your type here these days.     allow me to formally     introduce myself.     if you haven't guessed,     am a slave trader.     obviously, my occupation     my name is eric. i'm     what you'd call.. a collector.     gives me many opportunities     to travel to far off places.     don't believe our     i think that i     encounter was chance.     can help you.     you see, you'll have a very     hard time trying to find any kind     of boat during this festival.     but perhaps if you're willing to     stick around till tomorrow, i think i could     arrange one of my own ships.     aw man, we have to     spend the night here?     have a bad     feeling about this...     something bad always     happens to us when we're     in a human city...

0265.jpg
what are the chances     trace, i don't     that we'd meet a guy who     trust this guy at all.     co happens to have a ship?     someone is organizing     these events, i'm sure.     you think it's     a trap?     i'm actually not sure...     dunno.     somehow, i think someone     this guy seems     knows what we're after.     pretty harmless.     you have the most wonderful     fur pattern, my dear!     ah yes, the white fur     goes all the way around.     erm, thank you...     think...     mer...!!     mean it! your fur     is absolutely lovely.     it's neat and clean,     perfectly even...     ouch..     and now... he     seems pretty injured.

0266.jpg
flora, stop!     did you see     what he did?     p-please forgive     my rudeness.     i truly did not     mean to offend you.     i'm just used to inspecting     my slaves in that way...     you see, most of the slaves i     deal with are traditionally much     more subordinate then you...     i'm not a slave!     oh... i'm sorry...     i was one once, a long     but.. don't     time ago, but i'll die before     understand...     i'm a slave ever again!

0267.jpg
she isn't a slave, then?     no, she's not.     flora and i, along with the     others, were simply traveling     together to.. uh.. here.     seriously?     must admit i'm     a little disappointed.     was really hoping     to buy her from you.     well, selling flora is     out of the question, even     if i was able to.     but we really need your     boat. is there anything else     you want in return?     well... now that i     think about it...     boat rides can be very     boring... there is something     flora can do for me...     if she's willing, of course...

0268.jpg
voilà!     these are my paintings!     as told you, boat     rides can be long and     quite boring.     if you would model     for me, would love to     paint your image.     wow, these are really good...     you want me... to model?     sure, you have quite an     exotic look to you.     oh... thanks,     i guess...     ...and if you want,     we can, ya know, have     some fun afterwords.     a little... private     entertainment...     slashu

0269.jpg
well, what do you think, flora?     0-ow... i forgot, sorry.     i'm not sure i deserved that,     should we trust him...?     though. eh, well...     my offer still stands. i'll     take you aboard my boat in     the morning if you want.     if you don't mind, i     need to find my healing     crystals, excuse me.     eh, as much as i hate     to admit it, we need him.     but i'm not going to enjoy     it's the perfect opportunity...     posing in front of him.     you'd better make sure     he doesn't try anything.     i make sure...     and hey, we might as well     make the most of tonight.     we get to take a bath,     sleep in a real bed...     and in the morning, we'l     be sailing across the seas!     yeah, that does sound     kinda nice... mrr...

0270.jpg
well, looks like things have     finally died down outside.     -sigh- i wonder if i used     to enjoy things like this.     feh, not likely. from what i can     tell. this would probably be something     i would try to shut down.     still haven't worked up the nerve     to read the rest of my old journal.     they should rave     come on, they     a festival for me...     finally got the water     these ke dram don't     warmed up.     deserve anything.     hey, what are you     doing out here?     hey trace...     oh, nothing... just     thinking, you know.     ....murr...     don't be so     moody, trace.

0303.jpg
one week later...     it's been smooth sailing     so far. if we keep this up...     i think this will be     very uneventful trip.     everything seems     so tell me, trace,     to be going well.     how is flora doing?     oh, she's alright.     the first few days were     a little rough on her.     ah, good, good!     i'm glad. i've been waiting     for a chance to paint her.     but she hasn't     do you think, perhaps, she     gotten sick lately.     could be available this evening?     oh, right, the paintings...     aw come on...     i'd almost forgotten     do i seem like :     about that deal.     pervert to you?     i suppose...     um, tell me...     you're not going     just have her stop by     to have her pose...     my cabin in an hour, and i'll     lewdly, are you?     have everything set up.

0304.jpg

0306.jpg
but... when our     family acquired kathrin, she     was just a kitten.     was     now, don't get me wrong,     only ten at     the time.     flora. i have spent...     "quality time" with several     of the servants own.     at first she was     but...     almost like a pet. but     we got older...     i wont deny that we     fooled around occasionally,     we were kids after all. we     were curious.     i guess i just respect her     too much to do that.     she really means     a lot to me...     ...i usually spend our nights     teaching her how to read.     huh... maybe i had     now please     this guy all wrong.     take off your robes and     maybe he isn't such     bend over against that     a pervert after all...     pole over there.     well, enough     about my past...     hm... i think this is a     good enough warm up...

0307.jpg

what do you     hm... so     mean..?     tell me, flora...     how did a keidran like     yourself end up traveling     with trace, a human?     well. it's highly unusual     for a human and keidran to     huh... it's been     be traveling together.     so long...     especially now     that... well.. war     aya,     s so close.     trace... he saved my     life, when we first met.     it's pretty obvious     was a runaway.     you two are a couple.     i was scared of him at     how did that     first, too. i feared he would turn     happen?     me in. but he never did.     and... i guess i     we've been traveling     loved him for that.     together ever since.     eventually one thing led     to another and we... uh... did     as all animals do... ahem.     hm, flora's more     attached to trace than i first     ...well, at least     thought. wonder if trace     i got her tail up again.     feels the same way?     this is going to be t     good painting...

get off me!     oh, i think you meant it     you're overreacting...     didn't mean it like that!     exactly as you said, whether     you realize it or not.     to be honest, i don't     trust keidran any more     than the next guy.     but flora... she's different.     i don't want her hurt.     i... don't want     her hurt either.     well, like i     said, i can't tell you     i guess... you're     what to do.     right. was wrong to     say such things.     but if you want     my advice, i suggest you     wait until you figure out     who you really are.     but i don't know     what to do...     nya!     hey flora,     no... didn't get     i'm back.     what i wanted.     but... i think got     what needed.     hey, that     was quick.     did you get     that fresh air you     wanted?

0321.jpg
flora... well, i guess     oh,     we should discuss what     you said earlier...     right! um...     what did     i say earlier?     you... you mean you     don't remember?     hm, let     me think...     er, n-no need!     it's okay!     we can talk     about it later, that might     be better...     er... nope...     i thought we were just     making idle conversation     before you ran off...     oh, okay,     if you say so,     trace.     phew! really didn't     heh, i figured     want to have to get into     he didn't want to     that conversation.     talk about it.     is it wrong that i'm     avoiding the question?     sigh... i promise     you, flora, i'll give you a     take your     proper answer soon, once     time, trace.     sort out myself.     i can wait.

third week...     crack!!     hurry up,     you idiots!     the storm's upon     us! take everything     down, now!     it was probably     just all that food-     flora, maybe you     should keep resting-     i rested     all yesterday.     my stomach     stopped hurting     hey, guys. have you seen     natani around lately?     hours ago.     oh yeah, think     he didn't open     he's sick or something.     the door, though.     he locked himself in     his room two days ago.     just told me to     leave it there.     it's been a while     since i've gotten him     any more, though.     he asked me to bring     down some food for him.     eh, i guess i'll get     it for... um... him.

0323.jpg
feh, what am     i, a butler?     ‹hey natani,     are you alright?     i brought you     some dinner...›     d     < keith? ah...     don't come in!     just... -huff-     leave it by the door.     ... i'm ill!     please, go away.     it's... contagious!›     ‹ don't be     ridiculous.     ‹i'm coming in...›     ‹ah! my lock spell failed!     we basitin don't get     i couldn't concentrate...     sick, i'm not in danger of     catching anything.›     grah, why do all eric's doors     come without manual locks?>     ‹what?! no..!›

0325.jpg
aw, jeez,     now i'm getting     emotional.     i despise     this body...     ‹nat, why are you     so insistent on dealing with     this by yourself?›     ‹well i...›     < know you're     ‹natani.     just helping me because     that's not why i'm     you know i'm a girl.     helping you!     you wouldn't be     if trace was     so eager if i was still     bedridden for two days,     a guy to you.›     i'd help him too.›     < just because you're     a "guy" doesn't mean you     can't accept help.›     «so, are you sure     < urgh, okay     there isn't anything i can     keith, if you want     do to help you?›     to help me...     get me something     for my headache.›     ‹yes, keith, i know     how you can heal me!     come over here and     de a miracle-worker!>

‹here ya go,     it's ready.›     ‹oh, thanks.     um, what does     do, again?>     ‹well, it should     just help you relax.     might make you a     little tired, too.›     ‹bleh! it tastes     ‹how do you     terrible!>     feel? it should work     quickly.>     < heh,     told you.›     ‹eh, i feel a     little better i guess.     4 a     not by much...›     ‹ah, well, i guess i should be     going now. take care of yourself,     ‹...eh? natani?     nat. call for me if you need-›     hey, you okay?›     nehm...

the storm's     getting rough. will it     only a little.     slow us down?     but we've made     good time.     winds have     been at our back for     most of the trip.     ah, that's     good.     hah, i think     hey, eric,     you're asking the     i have a question     wrong guy.     for you.     you know that     have a certain affinity     for keidran.     ask away.     you know that     but yes, it is rather     flora and i are a     unusual to find someone     couple, right?     who appreciates keidran     in the way i do.     is that...     strange?     but, i don't!     it's just flora l     care about.     you mean like,     serious relationship?     i've never heard of such     a thing working out.     well, don't     you know about     their life span?     what? why?     keidran only live to     be about 20 years old. by     the time you're in late 30's,     she'll probably be close to     the ends of her life.

0331.jpg
20 years?!     well, it     seems short     s that all?     to us.     flora said it was     short, but...     20 years is     hardly anything     keidran tend to     at all!     think we humans live     unnaturally long.     i'm afraid     not, trace.     many wizards have     wasted their entire lives     trying to find a way to work     around their mortality.     but... there     must be something     magic can do     can do!     many things, but even     it has its limits.     some kind of spell,     or potion, or     some keidran can     make it to late-20's, if     they're lucky, but...     think you should     don't tell me     enjoy the time you     what i can and     have with flora.     can't do.     i have     the power to do     what i want.     there's no point in     worrying about something you     flora won't die     can't possibly change.     if i have anything     to say about it.

0332.jpg
hm, i've never been     down here... oh, no, it's     the hussy again.     i hope this     storm doesn't slow     us down.     i'm getting sick     of this boat.     oh! hi, flora!     look at her, acting     all innocent.     what's up?     i wonder what she's     really thinking...     oh, hey,     it's flora!     hi, flora!     i wonder what's     up with her?     what are you     well, um,     up to? is that a     actually…     human book?     can't read..     it was illegal when     was a slave to     learn how.     oh, yeah,     i was just practicing     my reading.     if you want to read, feel     free to take any book you like     off the shelf. eric won't mind.

0333.jpg
you can't read?     that's not good!     oh, no, it wasn't trace.     thought mr. trace     was my... former owners     seemed nice...     who didn't teach me.     ah, know     what you mean!     huh, that must be why     i used to be     she likes eric so much...     owned by master     eric's brother.     ...yeesh... i wonder if     kat has back problems...     he never let me learn     anything, but eric saved     me from that placel     anyway, i can't read     well, but i can show you     what i know...     i usually read     the ones with pictures,     they're easier.     what the-? this book     is just filled with perverted     keidran artwork!     grah! eric,     you perv!     wait, pictures?     let me see this...

0334.jpg
hi, keith,     how's natani?     oh, hi, flora. he's     fine, just resting.     that's good.     i'm going to give eric     s-something     a piece of my mi-     wrong, flora?     uh, no,     no... nothing     wrong.     a     ...that's strange...     i thought i smelled... no, i     must be imagining things...     ugh, this storm     thank the     isn't letting up.     gods for breaks.     aaaahl     w-what have     you done to that     poor guy now?!     ye gods!     it's that basitin     again!     what     now...?     ailiseeeel!     wait... that     scent on you...     wolf in...     wait, stop,     didn't... oh, great.

0335.jpg
later..     jeez that     water's cold.     at least i've     finally gotten natani's     scent out of my fur.     ...and stopped being     perpetually excited...     r-r-r-reh...     kat, bring     honestly i'm     one minute i'm     the iodine-     not sure.     drinking tea, the next     flora's telling me not     oh, sorry,     to corrupt kathrin.     keith.     then i reassure     her with a harmless     pat on the rear, and...     this happened.     it's alright,     was leaving.... what     happened to you?     hey, wait...     oh, while     you're here...     where are ya going?     change mike! i need     a new fox girl!     i've heard word     that you know some...     basitin magic...?     f it's true...

0336.jpg
trace, check out     oh, yeah,     my new pi's!     they're nice...     trace, you didn't     look! ...aren't you     coming to bed?     no. need to finish     this first. you go ahead.     heh, funny. well as     aw, come on, trace,     tempting as that offer is...     come to bed.     seriously, i've got a     i'll even give you     lot more work to do.     the honor of giving me     a foot massage!     i'm gunna be at     least another hour...     oh, okay...     trace, you idiot..     well... i guess "ll     go to sleep, then...

0337.jpg
bah, i just don't     understand enough     why?     why? because if     of this magic...     i don't, flora will die in     i need to     only a few years...     remember..     las     is that all?     well... part of me     really wants to know more     yet by working too much,     about my past, too.     you're wasting the time you     have with her now.     look at what     you're doing.     you're fighting to extend     flora's life, so you can spend     more time with her later.     the future is     never certain.     enjoy the ume you     have at present.     sigh...     hm? oh, change     your mind, trace?     mr, that was easy.     now the entertainment     begins... ah, to be young to     and full of energy...     yeah, guess i... talked     myself out of the work.

the air is     hurry up,     cool today.     keith!     the cold season     hate     is coming soon.     being naked...     fah! i hope i'm out     of here before my winter     coat comes in.     it'll be even harder to     conceal these stupid things     when i get poofy.     meanwhile…     uh... keith, sir?     hello, are you     in there?     keith….?     hey, i'm over here.     wait... isn't     what do you want?     that the wolf guy's     cabin?     what's keith     doing with his     clothes.     0-oh! uh... master     wants me to t-tell you to     we're at the island.     he wants your     help on deck.     alright, tell     him i'll be there     in a minute.     and... strips     of cloth? ...for tying     him up?! oh gods!

0345.jpg
nya-ahl     it's light out already!     trace must have let     me sleep in again.     tina     wonder where     he went...     eh-?     maybe i     have been eating     a lot lately.     which is why     those who are well fed     are considered more     attractive...     strange, usually     but for some     it's really hard for     reason humans are     people of my tribe     backwards.     o gain weight.     i guess i should be     more careful with what     eat, for trace.

it's so nice to finally     hey, watch     get off that ship!     your step, now.     here, let me help     you, my dear...     wow! look at all     hey, what's that     the... keiths!     supposed to mean?     there are keiths...     everywhere!     .... uh, sorry.     you all do kinda     look alike...     that's     not true!     i don't look like     any of them!     uh, guys...     heads up.     this doesn't     look good...     what have we done to     warrant the attention of all     three basitin generals?

0352.jpg
you know them?     let me     see if i can     recall...     not really,     but i've heard     about them.     ah, yes...     remember.     the one on the     left is the intelligence     pfff, right...     general, i believe.     i've been flying since     he's a veteran     before his ancient ancestors     of the military.     were even born.     he's been around since     the keidran-human wars.     they say his knowledge     rivals that of dragons.     the big guy on the right     i bet i could bite     is the arms general.     his head off faster than     in brute strength,     he could blink.     he's the strongest of     all the basitin.     he's a match for even     the mightiest of beasts...     such as a dragon.     as for the third...     i don't recognize him.     perhaps this is why my     brothers and sisters do not     care for lesser beings.     but he must be the current     the most powerful     standing master general.     basitin. able to take down     even... & dragon.     he's supposed to be     a lethal combination of both     intelligence and strength.

0353.jpg
you?     i was sure     surprised to see me?     you'd be gone     c4›     i'm surprised, too.     for good.     i never thought i'd     see your face back here     but now you're     after all these years.     back. so...     grahl     welcome home,     brother!     alaric... i...     can't breathe!

0354.jpg
general!     such gross displays     of public affection are     not at all decent.     besides, this one     is no brother of ours.     he is an outcast, as     you're well aware.     hmph! you come     to us with your feet     uncovered.     i'm sorry, general.     i didn't remember-     how indecent...     have you gone so native     1     as to walk around in the dirt     like a common dog?     don't you speak out     of turn, former keiser!     have you no shame?     you may have left as a     or have you grown used to     living like a keidran?     child but you're an adult now.     you follow adult laws.     look at me when i     speak to you, boy!     7     you always were     the runt of the litter.     aughi     you have brought disgrace     to your people and your nation.     why have you returned?

0355.jpg
that's enough,     alabaster.     let the boy     explain himself.     i was banished on the     condition that i could return     if i brought back trace.     i have done so. you     that is him...!     should recognize him.     but... no, it     can't be!     never in my years     has anyone retumed     from banishment!     flora, get up... we're     supposed to be on our     the conditions were     best behavior here.     supposed to be impossible     to accomplish!     you were meant to     nya, my legs are tired.     accept your punishment     with dignity and die!     you were not     supposed to return!     and yet he has.     it's out of our hands     now, general.     we have no choice but to     grant little keith access back     into our glorious society.     it is law.

0356.jpg
you said it. i     can relax a little.     hey, looks like     they're letting them     that dark basitin     into the city.     magic is scary.     ah, good.     no more basitin     it was hard constantly     on the ship!     avoiding that guy.     i'd hate     to end up like     m-mike...!     that wolf-     ...huh. i     look at     feel strange...     yourself!     t-that basitin!     he cursed me!     ah! t-this feels     really weird! what am     i going to do?     ah?!     w-what's happening     to my body?!     woah... mike,     you look... hot...     what?!     mrahaha!     well, i'm starving. l     haven't eaten in weeks.     i'll undo the     illusion later, if     they can't.

meanwhile...     along with several settle-     ments near the borders.     general...     it's a full-scale invasion.     sire, we've just recieved     word - another village has been     attacked by the wolves.     the keidran are killing     indiscriminently; men, women     and children alike.     don't understand.     first our king and now this...     the templar have offered     why would they attack us?     their support in the fight-     the templar? those     damn magic-users probably     caused this mess.     does there need to be a     reason? they're animals, it     was bound to happen.     i have no love for those     beasts, but i never thought they     would go as far as this...     sire, with all due respect...     the templar are     the templar are loyal     greedy and corrupt.     protectors of our country.     can't help but feel     that somehow they are     responsible for this.     have the servants     ready my horse.     they would never dare     perhaps... i will try to     cause such a coup against     speak some reason before     their own empire.     this gets out of hand.

admit, don't know much about your     ah, the     childhood before the templar found you.     new student.     your parents were farmers     i've been     from a small rural village.     expecting him. this     way, please.     this will be your     new home. i think you     will enjoy it here.     110 but even then, as i watched you     arve for the first time, knew     you were not like the others.     as the years passed, you learned quicker     when you reached adulthood at 16,     then any of your peers. you had very few     you became a full-fledged templar.     friends, but it didn't seem to bother you.     you've made us     very proud, trace.     i expect great     things from you.     by then, we spoke regularly. you     seemed very happy those days.     but the happiness didn't last. after two years, you were becoming     that all changed when you met her -     frustrated. you often told me they were wasting your talents.     saria au gruhen. oh, trace, you should     have seen yourself. you were so cute.     you may have ended up a power-     you were still a teenager. you wanted adventure, not going on     hungry megalomaniac, but like said.     escort missions or finding a farmer's runaway property. but you     back then you were still a teenager.     were living in a time of relative peace. humans and keidran     were cooperating. so your frustrations continued unabated.

unfortunately, you were quite clueless when     unsurprisinaly...     it came to attracting a woman's attention.     you tried several indirect methods...     this isn't     working!     she doesn't     die,     beast!     hiss!     even notice!     it's fun,     though!     i keep telling you,     including...

a     and by the first of winter, you were married.     you began courting her in the fall.     e     a on     you purchased a home that was quite large for     that isn't to say things were perfect. the first time     a human dwelling, and moved in immediately.     you bought a slave for the house... saria, usually     so shy and soft-spoken, had a lot to say about it.     hm, you made lovely couple.     i think everyone in town     heard that argument.     for once, you actually seemed content with     your place in life. you didn't completely shelve     your templar ambitions, but you set them aside.     but despite your dramatically different     personalities and conflicting ideals..     somehow, you two seemed     to be made for each other.

everything was going well until that last week     you were traveling to your cabin in the     in late spring. this was six seasons ago...     forest, very near the keidran borderline.     run, it's     a ugen     rawn!     heehee!     mew?     aw, look! that little     keidran's waving at us!     how cute!     huh?     oh, sure.     i regret that i left before it happened. i later gleaned from various     minds and pieced together the events that took place on that day.

it was a wolf. not a professional assassin or     the first arrow was for saria.     mercenary. just some petty thief trying to take     advantage of a couple of isolated humans.     ah!     saria, what     and the second arrow was for you.     happened?     are you     get     okay?     downl     y-yes,     i think...     <oh, crap!     templar›     saria, are     a keidran!     you sure you're     okay?     go inside and lock     trace! please     it just grazed     the door. the house wards     be careful!     me, i'll be okay.     will protect you.     m going     after it!     wasn't your fault, trace. you couldn't have known.

so... it     killed her.     yes the poison spread     throughout her body. she died     before you could return.     yes.. and no.     and that's     why i did all those     your wife's death     terrible things.     was the start...     but it was what you did afterwards that pushed     you over the edge. you tried to bring her back.     in theory, it's possible to resurrect someone by stealing the life energy     by the time you were found, you were half-     of other things. this is what you know as dark magic. but in practice, it's     dead. your mind had been nearly destroyed     impossible. the dark energy kills the caster before the spell can finish.     by the black magic you had attempted.     the black magic's effects on your mind warped     your senses. you became crazed and paranoid.     for two years, you locked yourself away     in your home, rarely leaving for anything.     and then four years ago, you emerged     you had the old master templars killed, and in their place, your own inner circle.     and procaimed yourself grand templar.     master spy, master architect, master strategist, master seer, master mage.     with these men, you took control. and quickly the templar     changed from a mage guild, into an order to rival the military.

back at the ship...     we're friends,     no, you black-     i... said...     it's no big deal!     mailed me!     no way!     come on-!     you promised!     i'd show you!     we're pals!     noi     woah...     that's weird.     i'm smaller than i used     to be... but i feel as strong     bash/     as before, and my reach     seems the same.     maybe this     really is just an     illusion.     if that's the case,     i should still be able to beat     evals in a fight...     evals, the last two days     you know     have been nothing but stress. i just     i'd never strike     need to let off some steam.     a woman.     so if you want to do     something useful for once,     get up and fight me.     fight you? l     can't do that...     then this is     going to be a really     one-sided fight!     no, wait! aaah!

alaric, i don't     know.     understand. how could     that's true.     you have known i'd be     here with trace?     your mission to     find trace was supposed     to be impossible, so you'd     be banished forever.     the other     but against al     general said you didn't     odds you did it!     expect me.     we honestly     had no "political"     look, trace     plans for him.     isn't your concern     but now that     anyways.     he's here, the templar     are demanding trace     be returned.     i don't like taking     we're going to     orders from them, but     take care of that one     building this tower gives     ourselves.     them leverage.     the problem is, the     giving them trace     templar believe his friends     is what it takes...     know too much now.     ...what do     you mean?     well, the human known     as eric, his slaves, and the tiger     aren't immediate threats.     the only one we're concerned     about is the wolf. the templar believe     he's a spy. they want him removed.     the other generals wish     to... test your loyalty.     wait... you're     asking me to... to     kill natani?     we're not     asking, keith.     i'm ordering you to kill the     wolf known as natani before your     trial tomorrow morning.

0413.jpg

0414.jpg
alright...     grand l     here's the     world map.     and this is where     nora said it was.     22mm-homd     a place where humans     and keidran live together...     but... this takes us right     trace, this     through my homeland...     is dangerous!     edmmire     res     "dangerous?"     why?     trace, don't you     remember what you are?     you're... a human!     my people have     a     very little interaction     er folk     with your kind.     im thesi     wateri     even on horseback it's a     long distance, but if we reach     it, we'll finally be safe.     most haven't even     seen a human beforel     and if they found     out you are... were     we can figure out what     a templar...     to do when the time comes.     it'll work out, i'm sure.     i know what     you mean, but it's the     only way there.     if we tried going in from     the north-west or east, it'd     take months longer.     the reason it's so well hidden     is due to the fact that it's difficult     to reach from the human side.     i hope so.

0415.jpg
flora, what about     natani? where will he     be going? with us?     ‹natani, are you... huh?     where did he go?›     oh, i hadn't     thought of that!     i'll ask him!     natani? where     are you going?     < how am i supposed     o spy on people i can't     even understand?     i just needed     besides,     some fresh air.     i'm just going     for a walk.›     <is there something     wrong with that?>     you know you're     supposed to be spying     on the human.     yet you haven't     been spending much     time around him...     just a walk, huh?     doesn't have anything to do     with the scent trail of ; certain     basitin you're following?     t-that's a     coincidence!     this has nothing to     do with keith!     i just happen to be     going in the same direction     his scent is going...

0416.jpg
w-when i heard     you'd left the village...     for weeks i tried to catch     up with you, to e-explain why...     i realized how much     of a mistake i'd made     but you crossed the human     in running away.     border. i had to turn back.     i returned home, but     i couldn't stop regretting     what had happened.     i couldn't stand it! l     tried the only way i could     think of to reach you.     half a year ago, i left     everything and came here.     the basitins were kind to me.     they let me stay, but told me you'd     never return from banishment.     didn't care. had     a-and... um... that's     made up my mind to see you     how i ended up here...     again, or die waiting.     all so i could say...     i'm sorry.     ‹ there he is!>

0417.jpg
but you still     haven't told me     ...honestly,     why you left.     there is n-no good     reason why.     there's nothing that i     could say to excuse what i did,     but i can try to explain.     though my p-parents approved of our     union, when you weren't around they     i didn't believe them,     expressed to me their apprehension.     i-i knew it wasn't true what     they were... & bit     they were saying.     frightened of you.     b-but i became     overwhelmed, i wasn't     sure what to think.     the whole village was. none had ever seen     basitin before, but there were so many     temble rumors about your race going around.     especially once you proposed. so many     eventually, i couldn't take it     people told me what a mistake i was making.     anymore. p-panicked and ran.     n-never intended to stay away. l     just wanted time to think. but once     1t-thought i had     ran, i didn't know what to do.     time to pull myself     together.     didn't know     you'd leave and never     come back.     was ashamed. i didn't know how to     face you again. so i stayed hidden,     even when i heard you calling for me.

0418.jpg
you mean all of this,     you...     everything... was because     you couldn't talk to me?     i looked for you for days, until i was     forced out of the village. they told me     you didn't want to see me again.     do you realize how that     made me feel?! and you could     have prevented everything!     i-'m sorry.     hey, stop.     never wanted     get up!     you can't-     you to be hurt. i know     not in the middle     it's my f-fault...     of the street...     damn it. i shouldn't     be the one feeling guilty!     it's... just one thing after     another! what more am i going     to have to endure today?     il     rumble!     sigh...

0419.jpg
‹what's wrong     with her?     a little yelling     -snirk-     and she bursts     into tears.›     e     ‹oh, don't even     or cin     start, zen!›     tch, women...     laura, i'm sorry     for yelling at you, i lost     rumble!     my temper...     to be honest, ever since     last saw you, i've wished for     the day 'd see you again.     i don't want to     ruin this by fighting.     let's just talk.     laura, i am     glad you're here.     please, stop     crying.     keith...

i dunno,     i think it's kinda     neat? weird's     oh... well, i...     neat.     more like it. i know     a language i didn't     i just told     yesterday...     them you were with     me, so they couldn't     touch you.     what     did you say,     "diplomatic     anyway?     immunity.*     ah…     after we're done     and said our good-byes to     keith, we'll leave and head     so...     towards lyn'knoll.     what did     it should take a lot less time     eric say?     than it did to sail out here. the     island is much closer to the east     coast than where we left.     he did have... one     eric?     condition though.     he agreed     for going out of     to the plan.     his way, he wanted you to     model for him some more...     er, once a week.     once a-?! no!     wait... you didn't     agree, did you?     well... yeah,     we need to ship     to get back.     trace! why would     you do that?     i'm not getting     upset because of eric. i don't     like it, but i'd probably agree to     it again if / was asked.     huh? what do you mean?     you did it last time. why are you     i'm upset because you     getting upset about it?     made the decision for me!

0436.jpg
flora, what's the big deal?     you know eric's ship is one     that's not     of our only options off this island.     it's small price to pay.     the point, trace!     n case you've     forgotten, before | met     you i was a slave.     i've spent the majority     of my life having people     make decisions for me.     anaz     and i worked     hard o escape     from that lifel     sal     you don't own me,     trace. you can't just use     me as boat fare.     and if you can't understand     how something like that could hurt     me, then maybe you're even more     gal     clueless than i thought!     flora, wait!     flora!     slam

0437.jpg
sigh... damn it.     flora's right. i really     must be clueless.     never even     thought how she might     feel about it.     i don't know what flora     sees in me. i've done nothing     but put her in danger.     trace.     hm?     what is it?     i am here to     inform you that you have     been summoned by the     master general.     sigh, alright.     44     i'll go as soon as     the rain stops.     no. we     need you to come     with us now.     huh, now?     this weather?     canary     end.

trace has been kidnapped, everyone is     in danger, and everything hinges on the     decisions     a single banished bagftin.

oh, would     you shut up     already!     you're not     helping!     thanks a lot,     w-what have     brother. now i     i done now?     look insane.     er, keith... not you...     was talking... to zen, my     brother, in my... head...

0440.jpg
hm? did you say     oh, right...     your brother?     the one i... stabbed     through the chest.     i'd almost forgotten.     ..sorry. is he ?     oh, don't wony.     he's fine.     healed and     lazing about back     at our village.     though now he     spends all his days bugging     me. i think you should have     stabbed him harder.     speaking of which...     ...no. it's not.     you mentioned that     it was because of our     "link" before, but you didn't     job as assassins, yes. but we     say much about it.     were not linked by choice.     is it something all     you assassins have?

0441.jpg
i became linked with my brother     it was supposed to be easy. just     after our very first "solo" mission     kill an old wolf named issac as he     for the brotherhood.     traveled alone between villages.     assassins!     1104 1     hom     i've got him!     natani, wait!     what we didn't know was that issac knew     forbidden magic, and was willing to use it.     aaaaghl     the curse i was hit with was a terrible one.     it didn't hurt me physically, but rended my     mind and damaged portion of my soul.     although physically fine,     i was as good as dead.     natanil

0442.jpg
i swore i'd watch     over and protect her.     i'm sorry... there's nothing     physically wrong with her.     it's part of her soul     that's missing. we cannot heal     something like this.     she's all i have left...     beg you, anything!     please... there must     be something...     po.     in order to save my life, my brother melded     4/8.     his soul with my own. his soul kept the pieces     110     i... -sigh- there     is one possibility...     of mine together and filled in anything missing.     but... it would require     ola     your own sacrifice.     310     e     21023     999     'hoy . .     100 g     303l2 q^     but the effects were irreversible.     006 -     and having his spirit in my     body changed me. his mind     filled in my missing pieces...     one happened to be my     gender... so i copied his.     and... that's how i ended up being     male in mind, and female in body.     zen and i became     permanently mentally linked.

0443.jpg
it took a while to adjust to being mentally linked to my brother.     n the beginning, we didn't know how to block out thoughts and sensations from each other.     when he felt     when i had a hangover, so did he.     when he went to the     pain, i felt pain.     bathroom, i... well, you     get the idea.     be more     careful!     it... wasn't pleasant.     ironically, issac, the wolf we were supposed to kill, died     casting that curse. it's forbidden magic for a reason...     it tends to kill its user.     so our mission was     considered a success.     rumor spread that we were such     skilled assassins we had caused ,     the story became more and more exaggerated     a powerful mage to kill himself.     - mostly by us while we were drunk - until we     eventually became known as the "magi brothers."     he took one look at     that's     us and kill himself right     amazing!     on the spot! honest!

0444.jpg
you know, i've never     and that's the     told anyone that before.     whole story.     am i the only one to     find out about you?     well, there were a     few others early on...     including a brat from     way back when i first began     my guild training, but...     ...you're the first in     a very long time...     ah, i see...     ...keith,     um... listen...     ..don't mention it.     although i would     have... rathered no one     found out about me...     ...how do i say this?     i'm... glad it was a person     like you, at least. i appreciate     you keeping my secret.     it means a lot to me     to know that, if for no one     else, i can trust you.

0445.jpg
er... wait...     hey, keith?     j-just a second...     hang on!     ah, uh, what do     you need, flora?     keith. have     you seen trace?     we kinda got     into a fight, and i     kicked him out.     i felt bad about it,     though, and i wanted     can't find     to apologize, but...     him anywhere!     have they taken     sorry, flora,     him already?     i... i don't know     lying to my     where he is.     friends, now...     there's no honor     in any of this...     thought that     they were going to     waiting for me.

0446.jpg
say, keith, while you're     up, could you get me another     towel? i'm still damp.     what?     i'm not wearing     anything!     alright, the     coast is clear,     the closet's just     natani.     down the hall! please?     oh, alright.     hmph...     hm?     at least it'll give me     some time to think.     i'm telling you,     something strange     3 going on...     ever since that tower began     and did you see     lighting up, the generals have all     that statue general     been behaving strangely.     alaric made?l     they've been giving     weird orders and acting     erratically…     actually...     think alaric's always     been like that.     haven't you     noticed it?     but i know     what you mean. i've     noticed it too.

0447.jpg
mean, attacking     evesdropping, see.     someone from behind...     how like you...     it just doesn't feel right.     i also heard something     from the inner guards... they     say the king is sick with an     unknown illness.     and that the whole     reason for the tower being     hey, don't     built in the first place is to     speak so loudly     keep the king alive!     about that!     general, how...     when did you-?     w-what are you     talking about?     and as indecent as     have time.     ever. i'm suprised you're out     i... have until     here fooling around instead     tomorrow-     of following orders...     considering     how little time     you have left.     plans have     changed.     knowing how... important     this trial is, i've spoken with the     no/ you returning     king and had your trial personally     from banishment is     moved up to tonight.     what's unfair!     your orders must still     it's a mockery of     be carried out before the     our laws and our judicial     trial begins, however.     system. you will do as you     are ordered to do!     your time limit     is now one hour.     you have     one hour!     w-what?!     one hour?     once you've completed your     orders, you must light a candle in     the window to indicate you--     that's unfair!

0452.jpg
a     this is your fault.

all my life, all     i've ever wanted was     to come home.     wanted to be     with my people... my     friends... and i came     so close...     i thought     i could just let     we basitins are     myself do it... biologically predispositioned     to follow orders. the urge is...     overpowering.     but now...     what are you     i'm going to lose     talking about?     all. because     of you!     what?!     it would have     been the easy way.     but can't...     i can't...     i won't!

0454.jpg
fwo°su!     aaargh!     ugh...     alright, you'd better     explain what's going on     real quick, keith.     shink!     why did you     well you'd     try to kill me, and then     better try.     turn around and try to     that was an     kill yourself?     immobilizing spell.     you're not moving until     i get some answers.     want you to tell to     ...it... it doesn't even     me everything.     matter anymore. i've run     out of time. i've failed...     you're not a basitin.     you... you wouldn't     understand.

0455.jpg
g-general?!     that is our...     sir, the hour has     passed, yet there is no     own tavern!     signal from kaiser.     so, he has     failed. as had forseen     there are our own     he would. good...     ...burn the     people in there. and kaiser     tavern down.     still needs to stand trial-     j     smash!     don't you dare     talk back to mel     i said burn     yes, sir...     it down, nowl     urgh..     y-yes,     sir!     keith will pay for     killing cornelius yet!

oh, not to worry.     he's essentially harmless.     that platform he's lying on is     of my own invention.     are you sure it's safe     leaving him out in the open     like this, randal?     it creates an effect     call a mana sink.     mana in gathered in large enough     quantities tend to crystalize.     our towers are basically storage     batteries. templar work to draw mana     into the towers, where it joins with     the existing crystals to grow larger.     then the mana energy from the crystals     can be used by those linked to the tower.     in essence, towers provide a store of     energy vastly greater than any single     you are familiar, of course,     mage could retain on his own.     with the basic fundimentals of magic     and how our towers function.     the platform is linked     directly to the tower and it's     draw of mana energies.     this creates a constant     ete*     force that siphons mana from     anyone standing upon it.     without mana, there is     no magic. and without magic,     trace is an ordinary man.     lad

one explanation later...     keith... he... he gave     everything to save me!     he had the chance to get     ...and that's     back all he lost as a child, but he     about it, i guess.     chose my life instead...     and risked losing it all...     if i was given the chance to     get back my village and all my friends     i don't know if i could,     and family i lost as a child...     but keith... he did. he cared about     ...would i have been willing to     my life that much...     do the same as keith, and give i     all away to save his life?     natani? i told you     no.     everything... why are you     since you can't move,     staring at me like that?     there's something i've always     w-what?!     still have to report my     wanted to do to you...     failure at my trial.     can you let     me go now?     w-wait, stop! don't     those are     touch me there!     sensitive!     they're so soft!

0458.jpg
enough, already!     1-i'm not really sure...     why are you     i should still be furious at     acting so strange all     you for attacking me, but... you     a     of the sudden?     risked your life to save mine.     ...keith, i think there     is something that...     that i have to admit     to you... and to myself,     even though i know     before its too late...     you're guy... i can't     keith... l     help feeling this...     fire/     keith! the tavern's on     fire! we have to get out!     it's locked!     oh, gods! we can't     be seen like this!     some weird guy just     gave me the master key!     can this help?     l-let's not panic! the     door is locked, remember?     sigh...     alright, let's panic...

0459.jpg
ultra lock spell!     i'm not letting     this happen to     me again! i am     sick and tired of     people walking     in on me, inter-     40 o     rupting me...     g     20111 y     ...of otherwise     woah!     wrecking my life!     stay out!     i'm supposed to be     a bloody assassin,     for god's sake!     keith!     y-yes, ma'am...     er, mean, sir!     i'm going to unparalyze you now,     so get up and get dressed.     and don't you dare try to     kill me, or yourself, or anyone     smooch!     yeah, so... there!     else until we get out of this     okay? i just wanted to     mess, you hear me?     get that off my chest. don't     look too much into it!     and one last thing!     y-yes?     mmph?!     now get up! i'm     getting us out of here!

0460.jpg
well, i hope     but seriously, i meant what     you're satisfied.     said. i will help you how can.     you know, you really     don't look all that different from     hee hee,     when you were a guy.     appreciate     i bet with a little work, we     could get you looking like a guy     again in no time!     and then maybe later     we can go and confront that     basitin together!     whadaya     say, buddy?     well, i guess i might     well let him be for now.     i'll bug him lat- eh?     mike? huh,     he must have been     exhausted...     hey, mike! leggo!     you've got my tail!     hmmm...     we e-ell... i could     just risk waking him up     but... that     to get my tail loose...     would be rude!     e

0461.jpg
as reassuring as     your tower is...     i have heard many     rumors of the destructive nature     of trace's power.     you'll understand when say l     look forward to you templar leaving     my island as soon as possible.     no offense.     but you have nothing     to be concerned about.     i am quite confident in     my ability to contain trace's     power, if necessary.     your castle and people     are in no danger.     i understand. we shall     depart as soon as the storms die     down. our ship is being prepared to     contain trace at this very moment.     as the master architect,     i can guarantee you:     los     my technology     is infallible.

0462.jpg
‹alright, is every-     present!     body here? where's     is it just me,     the humans?>     or are all the exits     sealed off?     ‹i'm here, but l     can't find trace!>     <trace isn't in the tavem!>     <and the whole first     < explain later, but right     now i need to concentrate.     floor is on fire!>     <i've never done this     many people before!>     ‹done what?     wait a minute!>     ‹what are you doi-!>     bwoosh!

0463.jpg
swoosh!     oh. we're back at     my ship. facinating!     <i set a waypoint on     <so what may i ask did     <and trace is still missing!     the ship in case anything     happen back there?>     happened on the island.>     where is he, natani?>     think keith     should be the one to     ...keith?     answer those.>

0464.jpg
...and that's what happened...     keith... you     trace is probably at the tower     betrayed us...     now. they're preparing to take him back     to human territory, so they can attempt     to restore his memory.     yes, flora, i-     oh, no...     how could you, keith?     flora, please!     know you don't think     very highly of keidran, but you     were trace's best friend!     didn't our travels together     mean anything to you?     what keith did was     wrong, but he's trying to     make things right now!     make things right?!     i'm sorry... i didn't     he sold us out!     want any of this... i just     wanted to go home.     why are you defending     him, he (o tried to kill you! how can     you trust him after that?

0465.jpg
a lower on the island?     but i feel like i've     heard this before...     why would the templar     do that? doesn't sound like     the templar i knew...     basitins... magic..     roderick, is     that a basitin?     she's the only one that i know     oh, yeah, that's     of. she was a failed experiment.     vehra, master templar's     the master mage found     personal pet.     some way to give basitins the     ability to wield magic.     where can i get one     of those? i've never heard     of a basitin slave.     but apparently after a     while forcing magic makes     'em go soft in the head.     she used to be pretty     skilled, but now she can hardly     speak in full sentences.     this is all just a ruse...     they're fooling the basitins into     that sounds exactly like     lobotomizing themselves.     the templar i knew.

0466.jpg
the tower's     knew it!     a trap?!     yes! using magic     will slowly drive your     people insane.     i knew those     templar were up     to no good!     keith!     you have to     they won't listen to me!     warn them!     until my trial, i'm still     considered an outsider!     even if i do warn them,     basitin bureaucracy will prevent     them from doing anything about     it until it's too late...     but we have to     what can we     do something!     do, though...?     and we still need     to save trace!     it's risky, but...     keith! you said that the     bwoosh!     tower was incomplete, right?     was there any openings left     in the outer wall?     wha-? well... yes. last     keith, if you can     get us in there...     time i saw it, there was a hole     still left in the side. why?     think i know how we can     take down the tower and     save trace at the same time!

0467.jpg
completed towers are     very resilient to attack,     because its core is protected     however, if the tower wall is still     dy a strong crystalline barrier.     incomplete, the core will be exposed.     with enough force, a     strike to the core will     this will take out     begin a catastrophic     the tower... and     chain-reaction, causing     likely half the castle     the crystals to release     195 % • soma with it. that'll give us     all their mana energy     the distraction we'll     at the same time.     need to escape.     <so, if - and this is a big if - we can get into     the castle courtyard, we then grab trace,     <natani, you're our only magic     snipe the tower, and run for our lives.>     user. do you think you can hit the     tower with a magicked arrow?>     <i don't know how i feel     about saving a human, but he's     better out of templar hands.>     <'ve only got one shot,     but if you can get me up to it,     i can take out!>     <a-actually, i- can->     alright, let me get a map...     <0-oh, okay...>

0468.jpg
there are three bridges     leading up to the castle.     a central bridge, and     two lesser bridges to the     north and south.     reaching the bridges shouldn't     be a problem. it's after curfew, and i     don't hear any alarms going off.     so they probably don't know     we escaped the fire, yet.     but getting across those     bridges will de : lot harder     ah!     without being detected.     the castle side will     be well defended.     keith! no, you can't     you guys take the     north and south bridges.     go by yourself!     have to... even if destroying the     tower means saving my people, i will still     they are out of the way     be marked as a traitor for aiding you.     and easier to cross.     must face them alone, but at least     can serve as a distraction.     will take the central     bridge alone and draw     their attention away.

0469.jpg
kat, i want you to     go get mike and evals     and prep the ship.     out of the question!     why?     what? no! i'm     coming with you!     it's dangerous enough     as it is, and the less people     out there the better!     now do as i say and     help prepare the ship!     if you don't see a flash     of light from the tower in an     hour. i want you to leave.     keith, before you go...     natani explained to     me what you did for us.     he explained to me about     you basitin and orders...     although i'm still not sure if i     understand... or forgive you yet for     what you let happen to trace...     i'm sorry for hitting you.     well, it doesn't matter now.     all that matters now is stopping     the templar and getting trace back.     so let's get this over with.     i'm going out now, you guys follow     when the coast is clear.

0470.jpg
e-excuse me...     so why do you fight     y-your own kind?     oh, my dear, we humans are     not so different from you keidran.     we have both good and bad.     i- 1 just wanted to ask...     many of us do not agree     you are a human...     with the templars.     s-still! risking your own     how can i not be?     life t-to save the basitins...     i can't just stand     i've been told humans     idle while the templar     were heartless, b-but you're     perform genocide!     nothing like i expected.     you're -very brave.     what the templar     are doing is evil!     and must do everything     in my power to fight for what     consider to be right!     wow     so noble!     because no basitins     means no basitin women!     crasu!     and can't let that happen!

0471.jpg
(y)     c     'm sorry, brother...     this is the end.

0472.jpg
...what's that?     wha-? well, uh, this     just makes light out of mana.     why are you here?     i thought you were     going to stay on the ship?     1 - i decided to come     but this is very     with you. i'm not going to     dangerous!     abandon keith a-again.     if he's doing this,     then will a-as well.     i - i also owe the basitin     people a lot, f-for their hospitality.     must help anyway i can.     you're better off on the     ship where it's safe!     not that it will make     any difference now.     you should listen to     the human, mongrel.

0473.jpg
not so fast, fiends!     there it is, the bridge!     and the coast is clear...     -. .     you might as well give     yourselves up now, for you have     aw crap, it's the     no chance of defeating me!     musclehead general!     geh... musclehead general?!

0475.jpg
aaaaahah!     yaaaahhh!     hey, guys, eric     want's you to... er...     kyaaaaaahhhi     oh my...

0476.jpg
nya... natani...     armed? fah!     what need do i have     for weapons?     ah, don't worry, flora.     it would be shameful just     we can take this guy. it doesn't     to scuff this armor in battle to the     look like he's even armed.     likes of villains such as you!     at least he isn't     very bright! eat steel,     musclehead!     my body is the     only weapon i need to     achieve victory!!     ...are all basitins     insane by nature?     ...maybe...     ...oh crud...     we're screwed.

0477.jpg
this doesn't look     ..laura?     good. you better stay     what the...?     back, laura...     looks like the vixen has abandoned     i could stop you right now,     you. typical keidran cowardice.     but i am old, and do not have as     though in this case, she may     much fight in me as i once did.     have been wise to do so.     and know you are     no warrior either.     we are both men of scholar,     so i have a proposition for you.     but if you cannot, you shall     surrender, and tell me everything     your friends are planning.     if you are able to tell me any to     i suppose i don't have     common knowledge i do not already     much of a choice.... fine, a     know, i will allow you to pass.     battles of minds it is.

0478.jpg
so you see! the templar     set you up! it's slowly     see.     driving you insane.     i had my suspicions     that the templar might have     been trying something...     so now you see why     have to stop them!     you have to     let me through-     no!     what?     i told you everything! the humans,     the templar... you know now....     nick, you should be     helping me...     you have no right     i do what's commanded, even     to call me that, keith!     if i feel it's wrong. that is what it     means to be a basitin.     i'm not broken like you.     cannot disregard the laws that     have built our society.     it's for the courts     to decide what should be     done with the humans.     as for me, i must do as ordered     by the king and my orders are to stop     you and your friends here.

0479.jpg
raaawwwr!     whine...

0480.jpg

the capital of the     wolven territories is-     -karne, population     36,000. you'll have to do     better than that.     ok     the first great war ended-     -on march 1$ of the     second century, 181 ce...     if you could call that     pathetic skermish between you     and the keidran a war.     …erm... my middle name-     1/ali     but that's not     general knowledge     question, is it?     -is adrian; after     your grandfather.     are you prepared to     surrender your friends yet?

0483.jpg
hey... what     is that?     j     dunno.     what's wrong     with the core?     salsa     oh...     bav-loosh!     ah?!     the mana sink on     the ship is done.     very good.     0~     that's bad...

0485.jpg
there!     don't worry. the courts     will probably just have you     two deported.     our laws are not     cruel. tough but fair     is the basitin way!     those two should     be saving trace.     eh? who are you? what     do you know about it-     wait….there's something strange     about you... you're not basitin...     what are you?

0486.jpg
meanwhile.     don't give up,     master!     well, is that all     you've got, boy?     ugh... this is     hopeless... i can't     outwit him!     kathrin? i told you     to stay on the boat!     come on, eric! there     must be something you know     that the old goat doesn't!     think! you're     the smartest person     that know!     i just couldn't! had to     see that you were okay!     there is one thing!     ah?!     it's a subject i     ahah!     consider myself to be     an expert on!

this is something     any keidran breeder     would know!     pffe.-con     ma!     during what time     cagay     is a keidran capable     of having a child?     huh?     s that all? surely you     could have thought up something     actually... you're wrong.     more perverse than that?     what, did you think an     old basitin like me would know     nothing about mating?     so you know...?     naturally! our kind may not     particularly care for the subject,     but we aren't ignorant of it.     conception happens     during estrus, of course!     of course la-     er, wait, what?     figured you'd think i     you see, unlike basitin,     no! i-it can't be! how     was trying to stump you with     could i not know?!     a perverse question.     keidran are only fertile a week     so instead, i came up     after they've been in heat.     with a trick question!     it works that way because     keidran, unlike basitin, use sex     to get to know one another.     if they are happy together,     they will continue to be together     even i knew     the answerl     even after their cycle has ended.     it's common knowledge...

0488.jpg
keith, it's over.     surrender before     aaaaal     it's too late.     ugh...     i don't want     to kill you.     ...l... i guess you're     then... don't...     right, alaric... we've... made     our decisions...     you have free will...     you have a choice!     have made my choice,     keith. i chose to stay on the     path of righteousness...     you chose the path of     rebellion. there's no turning     back now, brother.     now we... erg...     smash!     ah?!     ..have to live with it!

0489.jpg
no, the castle...     i'm standing on     it was a trick!     the section of the bridge     i damaged...!     if i keep backing     up, i'll lose him!     alaric, no!     i won't let     you get away!

0490.jpg
ah?!     paf!     ...hah!     i can't believe     made that!     t     alaric!     crumble!     keith?

0491.jpg
you... saved me.     no, haven't!     you've... decided to     go back to our side!     don't you get it yet, alaric?     it's not about sides.     maybe i have been away from     me?     home for too long now, but i don't care     about sides and politics anymore.     i just don't want to see     my friends hurt. not natani, not     trace, and not even you!     ...-maybe you're     keith?!     right. maybe... the laws     can't pull you up...     can be.. wrong?     aurgh!     can't... hold on...

0492.jpg
augh! alaric, hurry...     can't hold on...     just don't let go...!     keith, there's things i haven't     told you... things i couldn't work     up the nerve to tell you...     everything i did was     even my eye... i wanted     for you, keith...     you to be proud of me.     keith...!     alaric!!

0493.jpg
meanwhile.     you alright?     we need to go.     natani?     flora, wake up.     - gasp! ?     oh, gods...     no.     natani? d-did     i woke up just before     you do...?     you. he was like this.     ...but whoever did     do it was much more     powerful than me.     t-this is terrible...     hey! we don't     have time for that!     why would someone     we have our own     do something like this? even     in order to help us...     lives to worry about!     he didn't deserve to     die... not like this...     we've got to     get to the others!

0494.jpg
wait here, flora.     [ hey, who are you? ]     damn it!     scout ahead.     as an assassin,     stealth and discretion     [ it's past curfew, and     are my speciality.     this is a restricted area! ]     [ oh, wait. ]     i you're the wolf l     talked to before.]     0 0     remember me, from     yesterday? i guess... you are here     erm... how would     to save the human, yes?     you know that?     i'll look the other way... if you     i've been stalking you.     give keith this note here.     oh... what?!     also, as a lieutenant,     know what's happening     around the castle.     would like to     help you.     ...why?     i... have reasons. but     need a favor first.

0495.jpg
it's all in what i assume is basitin...     wow, that was a     though with a... disturbing number     close one, wasn't-     of hearts drawn on it...     hey! don't open     that! it's not yours!     hrmph...     i can't read     it anyway.     well, she's gone     now. let's go.     oh!     natani!     you almost dropped the     note! we don't want keith to     oh, sure... that     miss out reading this!     would be...     he always seems unhappy,     maybe settling down with a nice     basitin girl will do him good.     ...great...     don't you think?

0496.jpg
oh, hey! it's     we ran into     you guys.     a general too.     ah, good, you     made it! we got held     up by a general.     but eric out-     long story, though.     smarted him!     where's keith?     t-there he is!     gaspl     he looks hurt!     k-kei-!     kelthl

0497.jpg
oh, whatever.     i'll deal with the gay     rumors later.     keith, can you     hear me?     natani...     ... killed him...     don't talk like that. i     i've killed them     all... my morn, my dad...     remember what you said     my best friend...     at the graveyard.     they're all dead...     it wasn't your     dead because of me.     fault...     even if i could spare the     we don't have time     magic, healing wounds     enough anyway.     like this is beyond me.     i'll carry him.     natani, is there     anything you can     do for him?

0498.jpg
trace is on the     other side!     that must be it!     the huge door"!     halt!     don't move,     villains!     ah paa... thank you very     much for bringing me the rest     of your cohorts, eric.

0499.jpg
you whelps have made     a lot of trouble tonight.     and what     exactly was that,     general?     but now it's time     for me to finish what i     began at the tavern.     i am not yet too weak to     stand with my men when     the time calls for it.     thought you were still     bed-ridden. you shouldn't be     your majesty!     out here... in this rain-     woah, that's a... big     basitin. but... i thought     they had a king?     ...and that's her,     king adelaide.     they do...

0500.jpg
i've been hearing     disturbing reports of your     activities, general.     killing a fellow soldier...     burning down : basitin tavern...     manipulating a legal trial...     what is making you     act in such a way?     your majesty!     if i may...     the general's judgement is     being impaired by the magic.     basitin minds weren't meant     to wield magical energy.     it's been corrupting him, just     as it will to all basitin-     lies! nothing but lies!     he's working with the     keidran; trying to keep the     magic to themselves!     my mind has not     been changed!     my mind has never     been clearer; my body     never stronger!     'm averse to taking     the word of an intruder...     but i cannot ignore this     unnatural behavior.

0501.jpg
what? no!     until i can learn more     about what's going on, i want     these intruders detained and     taken to the cells.     they are too     dangerous! we need     to kill them now!     no, i said detained!     that's an order!     is that clear,     general?     an order...     i... can't...     i... yes... i mean,     and want you confined     no... i can't..     to your quarters as well.     i'll kill them myself!     aaaah!     aaaaaaaugh!     linnen

0502.jpg
keep focus, children!     we must keep up that     s-sir, he's moving!     field until i finish the sedative.     just continue holding him!     he wont regain full consciousness     if you maintain suppression.     it is imperative we get     trace back to human territory     and restore his memories.     we must find out what he     discovered before he was taken.     there, finished.     rodgach!

0504.jpg
no! keith killed cornelius!     he and all his friends     deserve to die!     general, i gave you     3 direct order to stop!     aaaaah!     nngh!     you leave me     no choice!     guards-!     natani.     (0     ...w-what now?!     crack!

0512.jpg
the templar should     have put you down when     don't think i'm     they had the chance.     afraid of you, boy.     you humans are     nothing but trouble!     i won't let you hurt     flora... or... the others!     you may have once     been a skilled mage, but now     you're just a child with power     beyond your control!     show you true magic-!     erk...!     i'm sorry i'm hurting you!

0513.jpg
aaaaah!!     i'll... kill you...!     natani, now's our     no... don't!     chance, do it!     laura... she's too close     to the tower... she won't be     right!     able to escape the blast.     natani, come on!     laura's given us this     chance, and it may be the     only one we get! we have     no other choice!

0514.jpg

0530.jpg

0532.jpg
i've gotta get out     eh...?     of here.. augh!     damn it, i can     barely move...     how long was     out? did any of the others     see me like this?     oh, come on!     why cover my feet     and nothing else?     oh, one of you     has finally woken up!     your injuries were     quite severe. i wasn't     sure if you'd survive.     so you were the     one who-!     is there something     huh?     wrong, miss?

0533.jpg
oh, the mask.     it's for privacy. prevents... temptation.     so... you don't     many basitin would be unwilling to receive     know who am?     treatment if there was a chance of being exposed.     many would also be unwilling if it were public     knowledge that they needed help at all.     so, we hide our eyes and     instead rely on our ears.     well. i can tell you're     keidran.     but beyond that. i don't have     and i... noticed you were female     information about your identity.     once i began examining you.     my lordl     this man is horribly     disfigured! i...     oh...     ...oh my...     phew...     and no one else     not since they     has been in here?     brought you in.     ..it is refreshing to see a keidran     that values modesty. i... did not think     it was possible for your kind.     um... well, there's     more work to be done.     i... i'd better go...

0534.jpg
a prisoner? no...     hey, wait!     what about me?     am i prisoner here     or something?     or... maybe? i'm not     actually sure. i won't stop you     from leaving this room.     but i suspect those guards     stationed at the exits are     there to keep you here.     with the king and her generals absent, the lieutenants     have been fighting amongst themselves to determine     but for now it     to be honest... i'm not     really sure what's going on.     who should take command. it's dissolving into chaos...     would probably     be best for you     to stay here.     we haven't     been getting orders     recently.     hmph, fat     chance...     anyway, i should go.     oh, we've set out     erk!     some clothes for you     on the table there.     hm?     this... is a dress.

okay, i'm all     hey, this isn't     dressed!     so bad!     no, no, no!     i can't wear a     dress! / won't!     w-well you can't     go around naked!     this dress was the only     thing we had on-hand that fit     someone of your stature!     it was made for     adelaide when she     was younger.     what happened to     the clothes i was in?     it's one floor     down from here. why     do you ask?     uh... all the possessions     from when you arrived were     taken to the storeroom.     ...miss?

0536.jpg
miss, i'm sorry.     as i said before, we     can't allow you to go into     please, i have     other patients' rooms.     to find trace!     but you don't understand!     sigh...     i don't even know if he's     well... there are laws     alive! i don't know any of     that make exceptions for     my friends are okay!     family or couples...     please.     and there is only     one room with a human     in it; it must be his...     but i don't know if they'd     allow a keidran to...     alright! i'll talk     mew? "little one"?     to the others and see     who is that?     what i can do.     well, your baby,     of course!     but i need to make     sure you and the little one     are all healthy first.

0537.jpg

0538.jpg

0539.jpg
look, it didn't mean     was under a lot of     anything... i...     stress, and... ng...     snrk..     nmmhm...     oh, it's so nice to finally     see my little brother growing     grraah!!     hey, natani.     into a young woman!     oooh, keith. you're so     if you weren't a     dreamy! i want to feel your warm,     thousand miles away     talking to your-     sandy fur against mine.     i'd kill you!     self again, eh?     keith!

0540.jpg
jeez, keith...     are you okay?     a-alright, if     you're sure...     i'm fine...     hey, where are     we anyway?     we're being held     in the far castle tower.     it's been converted     into a medical facility and     holding area for us.     the only way out is     through the front gate - or     down a long drop.     well. that's not     good... but i've been i     i'm not escaping.     worse situations.     huh?     i'm sure we can     come up with a plan to     break out of here.

0541.jpg
what do you mean     s-she's..!     you're not escaping?     we can't stay here!     if we don't tha     laura's dead.     gone. there was nothing left of her.     keith, that's not true!     you can't just give up!     and it's my fault. just like alaric, and my     mother, and my father. i killed them all...     didn't say i was!     i just have no reason to     leave anymore. this place is     my home, like it or not.     i might have given it     up again for laura, but now     that she's gone...     i will accept the consequences     then perhaps     of my actions from the new king.     you are in luck.

0542.jpg
it is i.. lynn. do     you remember me?     n     from alaric?     yes, i was instructed..     i have a document     before his death to have     for you from my master..     it delivered to you.     general alaric.     it was originally going     it's a legally signed     to be.. given to you yesterday     edict declaring you an..     official basitin citizen.     sland.     4487 lilga     after your trial, but, well...     chant possuez     eted and 24 pales     laa, se ka #u     too little, too late.     well, that's.. a     what's the point of     depressing way     having this when they'll     to look at it.     just take it away again     relax.     once i'm executed?     everything works     itself out.. eventually.

0543.jpg
could what the     basitin said be true?     am i really...?     in here is the     what would trace     room of the human.     say if i am? would he     please be brief.     think i had...?     no, the basitin     must be wrong! i can't     creak/     be pregnant.     it's impossible.     keidran and humans     have lived together for     centuries. it would have     happened before if it     could have...     she must have just     been confused by my     trace? are     keidran anatomy...     you alright?     hello, flora! trace     isn't here, but you're     welcome to stay!

0544.jpg
ngh...     but if trace isn't     here... where is he?!     the mark on your     hand has spread.     nora?     it's the corruption     of black magic.     eventually it will     augh...     consume you if you     keep using it.     what happened?     ah?!     where am i?     what am |     the basitins... are     doing here?     going to want some-     one to blame...     had... had to take     you away or they would     have killed you.

0545.jpg
but what about the     others? are they here?     sorry, trace. i could     only make... one trip...     rrrgh...     nora? what's wrong?     it took most of my strength     carry you back, and the rest     to heal your wounds.     trace...     when the tower exploded,     t drained and consumed all the     magic on the island.     unfortunately, we dragons     are creatures of magic. it fed on my     now that i'm sure     life while i was looking for you.     you're okay, i must sleep...     for a very long time.

0546.jpg
if i'm the only one here, flora     and the others might still be in     well, i can just...     danger. i have to go back...     huh? i can't...     oh... long     drop..     magic has been disrupted     throughout the island as result     of the tower's destruction.     i'm afraid you're     without your powers     for the time being.     trace... i know you want     to help them, but... maybe you     could stay here for a while?     at least until i fall asleep...     it would be safe here, and...     'd feel better if i wasn't going into     this long sleep alone...     ...i understand,     trace.     not while my     friends need me.     magic or no     magic, i've gotta     find them.     ....i'm sorry, nora.     i'd like to help, but i just     ...but i'm...     can't sit here and wait.

0547.jpg
meanwhile...     ‹hey, wait a minute!>     ‹where are you going,     keith? i'm coming too!>     ah...     looks like your     escort has arrived.     please get dressed,     your trial is scheduled     to begin shortly.     <stay where you     are, keidran>     <these are     basitin affairs.>     <your kind are     not welcome.>     wait! i...     are you sure about that?     having a keidran there will not     d like to have     help your case at all.     the keidran as my     confidant, so that he     may sit in during     my trial.     well, to be honest, i     don't care what any of     them think anymore.

0548.jpg
thanks, keith.     actually, i didn't     really want you to come     along at all.     but i figured you     wanted to get away     from the others.     huh? why?     well, you know,     what with you sort of...     broadcasting your gender     by scent right now...     i'm glad you     convinced these idiots     to bring me along.     so, what do you want     me to do? defend your     case or something?     n-no, that's     impossible!     relax, natani!     the other basitin     won't know a keidran's     gender by scent.     and our friends won't     be allowed in the castle.     you'll be safe for a while.     oh... thank you, keith.     my scent's supposed     to be magically sealed!     how was it dispelled?!

0549.jpg
this trial is a farcel     keith keiser was     it was corrupting     helping the basitin people by     all who used it!     destroying that tower!     there is no evidence of     that order was never legal!     this "corruptive force."     keith was only required to     bring the templar to regain his     citizenship, nothing else!     alabaster was out of     his mind when he ordered     that assassination!     and it doesn't change     the fact that keith keiser dis     obeyed a direct order.     enough. it's time     for the boy to speak     for himself.

0550.jpg
keith keiser, for the second     we five have been chosen     time you stand before this court     to determine your guilt, if any, in     accused of a heinous crime.     accordance with basitin law.     do you understand the     charges against you?     you are charged     with the following:     disobeying a direct order     from superior... trespassing on     royal grounds... destroying royal     property... committing treason     against the basitin government..     and breaking curfew.     yes.     d-did you just     then i, alabaster, hereby     say "alabaster"?     bring this court to order.     that's right.     ...son of the     i am lieutenant     late general     alabaster...     alabaster.

0551.jpg
see you've brought the     keidran with you as well... the one     no, of     you were ordered to kill.     course not...     then tell us, young     man, why exactly did you     disobey your orders?     are you mocking us     did you have a     by flaunting your disregard     legitimate reason? /     for the law in here?     legal precedent?     no, i had no     *legal precedent'.     that keidran, natani,     didn't follow     is the closest thing i have     the orders because..     to a friend right now.     couldn't do it.     there's no way     could kill him.     sicilco     you were right, alabaster.     our predecessors should     have seen this coming.     wha-?     the boy's just too     what does my     much like his mother.     mother have to do     with anything?

0552.jpg
oh please...     this trial is going to     be long enough without     a history lesson.     let's just get     on with it!     i disagree!     if it has relevance     on the case, i'd like     to hear about it!     believe it does.     knowing keith's lineage     when my father died, his belongings     were passed down to me - including     wha-? really?     may explain why he has caused     several personal documents.     so many problems for us.     the contents of some     were... revealing...     keith keiser, your     mother, cathleen, was     a western basitin.     that explains itl     no, it's the truth. your father kept it hidden, forging     he resists orders     papers after conceiving an illegitimate offspring you.     so easily because he has     no compulsion!     that's a lie!     my mother was     a legal citizen!     but the secret couldn't be kept forever. when     rumor spread, your father confided in mine.

0553.jpg
need to leave     this place, albion.     what are     you talking about,     comelius? leave     where?     i'm going to leave the     island... with cathleen.     suspicions about her origins     have been growing. any day now     what?!     i'll be questioned, and i won't be     able to answer falsely. but...     maybe if we went a hurt an     lands we,     listen to yourself! '     leave the island?!     1     it's the drink talking,     you can't be serious!     you'd be disgraced!     forever labeled a traitor!     it matters not. i will     no...! i can't let him     be disgraced either way.     destroy himself! not for     at least this way, i will not     a western harlot!     implicate her or keith.     i will leave     the child here.     he is a weak boy,     but i've done all i can     to toughen him.

0554.jpg
female district     hello?     let me in, cathleen.     general alabaster?     it's passed curfew, sir. it     thudi     wouldn't be decent...     thud!     thud!     well / won't     and what would you     allow it!     know of decency?     slam!     i knew it was a mistake the     moment i forged your papers, but     did it for cornelius' sake...     but now he's planning to throw     his whole life away because of the     mistake he made with you!     let go of me!     aaaaaaahhh!

0555.jpg
alabaster claimed that he was forced to kill     cathleen after being attacked unprovoked.     he did not anticipate what     would happen after he left...     he did not witness what lead up to cornelius'     death, but his last note detailed the aftermath.     comelius...     you..     i'll make     you suffer for     this, boy!     to '

0556.jpg
so keith keiser is a     westerner, and alabaster     was responsible for what     happened.     but what does     that mean in regards     to this trial?     wasn't my father...     it also gives motive behind     my father's recent actions.     manipulating keith's orders,     burning down a tavern...     it shows how     keith is able to act     my father hated keith for what     independently.     he was, and for killing cornelius. he     was willing to go to any lengths to to     however...     get rid of him for good.     keith, are you     alright? what did     they say?     think we     should recess.     agreed. we will return     after the counsel has had     time to deliberate.

0557.jpg
meanwhile..     the whole ship is     crawling with basitins.     i told you we should     have taken off when we     had the chance!     what were we     supposed to do?     it's a shame about     kat, i know. but...     the control spells are     gone, i can feel it.     if we just took     the ship and left...     could be free!     free..?     we couldn't just     abandon everyone     on the island...     did you check     everywhere?     yes, we've cleared     the only things left are     the ship. everything has     those two keidran talking     been accounted for.     under the floorboards.     1     pher...

0558.jpg
alright, mike. here's the     plan. we just play it cool, explain     i'm innocent,     swear!     ourselves, and maybe they     don't kill mel     hiding in here was     the dog's idea! take     him instead!     bring the other     two in here.     let me go! i know     ahem...     you're holding trace some-     where! get off of me!     the basitin government has acknowledged your status as slaves,     and has determined that you cannot be held responsible for     actions forced upon you. you are therefore to be expelled from the     eric?     island. you have one hour to make ready to leave. your ship will     be escorted out of basitin territory, and then you will be free to go.

0559.jpg
did you hear that?     we've been set free?     no way!     i'm not going     anywhere without     trace!     ..and those     other guys too,     suppose.     just like that?     well, guess     l     i'd better hoist     the sails!     if you refuse to leave,     vou will be trespassing and     your lives will be forfeit.     i'll raise     the anchor!     what are you     two doing?     not going any-     gerkl     where, i hope?     t

0560.jpg
well, what do you     expect us to do? you heard     oh. come on! aren't     him! they'll kill us!     you two the men in this     group? man up!     look, we're not cowards...     maybe they have a     ...okay, maybe a little...     point, flora... what can we do?     none of us are fighters.     ...but fighting     against the basitins     t     would be suicide!     well... i don't know...     and why     but the least we can do     should we?     is buy some time...     t     we've got a chance     for freedom, and i for one     am not giving it up!     b

0561.jpg
our control spells are     gone. we hold no loyalty     towards eric anymore.     so why should we risk     our lives and our freedom just     to satisfy your... your...     human fetish!     i do not have     but...     "human fetish"i     you're right.     i... i can't ask     you to just give up     your freedom.     i have painful memories     wait, wait, wait...     of my own escape attempts     "when you were a slave?'     when i was a slave.     you're not one now? isn't that     i can understand the     templar guy your master?     desire for freedom.     i

0562.jpg
huh? a keidran     no! of course not!     i'm a free keidran! trace     and a human...?     and i are... together.     (okay, maybe i have     a tiny human fetish...)     i've never heard of such a     no, of course he does!     relationship before. does he feel     at least, i sure hope so...     the same way about you?     after what i last     or is it a one-way     said to him, though...     thing, like with kat?     h-hey!     if eric comes back, you must     and he's a powerful     swear to make that human of     human, right? templar?     yours buy our freedom.     hmph... alright, look. i'm     not going to fight basitins, no     matter what. that's for sure!     but i can see now why     you want him back so badly.     and i'm not heartless.     t     i might be willing to try     stalling as best i can.     ..on one condition!

0563.jpg
nora? are you     asleep yet?     yeah, well...     as was     ah... trace.     climbing down i got     that's so sweet.     to thinking...     and i decided it     wouldn't hurt if i stuck     around a little while and     kept you company.     so... i decided to     come back here.     trace!     you're back.     you couldn't find any     way off the mountain,     could you?     completely     impassable.

0564.jpg
there's a passage at     the back of the cave which     leads to an old mine.     if you stay left,     sigh...     it'll lead you right     to the shore.     there's.. you knew     about that all along?     i was going to!     why didn't you     tell me before i nearly     ran off the cliffs?     but you were in such a     hurry to abandon me, i figured     you could find your own way     off the mountain!     hmph!     ...it's alright. i know, you have new     well, i didn't...     companions now. i can't expect     i didn't mean it to     you to forsake your friends for...     come across like that.     someone you don't remember.     my mind was focused     on flora and the others.     but i honestly did not     mean to hurt your feelings. i     didn't even know a dragon's     feelings could... er...

0565.jpg
so, nora...     how long does     this "long sleep"     usually last?     trace? why are     but i wasn't lying     you still here? i told     when i said i wanted to     you the way out.     keep you company.     might not remember,     but it seems like you were an     important part of my past.     think i'd regret it     if i didn't stay, at least     for a little while.     i know...     wait, i changed     my mind!     blarg!

keith keiser, you have     committed serious crimes     that we cannot ignore.     but the means at which     you may have been     you achieved it cannot go     acting in the best interests     without consequences.     of our people when you     destroyed the tower...     however. we must also     acknowledge that these are     unusual circumstances.     in lieu of recent...     we are prepared     to render judgement.     revelations, i am prepared     to grant you leniency.     rather than execution,     your citizenship will simply     not be reinstated.     you are once again banished     from these islands; this time, without     any opportunity to return.     you shall be escorted     out the way you arrived, along     with the keidran slaves.     however, this     leniency does not extend     therefore, your companions     to the outsiders!     are sentenced to death.     an attack on     our people cannot     be forgiven.     what?!

0567.jpg
‹wha-? hey!     get off of me!>     take the     keidran away.     and escort the     exile to the docks.     «what's going on,     keith? grr... let go!>     you haven't     given them a trial!     they destroyed the     tower for the good of     the basitin people!     we are not     obliged to give trials     that should count     to outsiders.     for something!     under the law, destruction     of government property is a     crime punishable by death.     ngh...     don't you     have any minds     of your own?!     i won't let you     do this! the laws     are wrong!     .is this still part     of the trial?

0568.jpg
keith, what     are you doing?!     the law is not a     religlous doctrine!     how dare you     blaspheme the law!     ...but i can't stand by     the laws were made to help     and watch it happen     then you'll join     us govern ourselves... but it's     anymore! i won't!     by their sides!     been left to rule on its own.     somewhere along     the line, it's been twisted     into... scripture!     and it's used as an     excuse not to think.     i've had to see my     family and friends die     from this mind-set...     guards! take     them away!     ‹natani, get     ready to run...>     <what the hell's     going on?!>     stop!     don't move!     put your     weapon down!

0569.jpg
-gasp!:)     natani…     huh?     this way.

0570.jpg
erm... was that     dramatic enough?     was told to make it as     dramatic as possible...     messenger lynnl     this is an active     courtroom. get out     of he- erni     y-your     highness!     a     magistrate.     lynn has informed me that     he has important information in     regards to this trial. i am here     to ensure that it gets heard.     yes.     i have a document written     by the late general alaric.

0571.jpg
my lady,     you're okay!     the healers feared i would     succumb to my illness without the     healing properties of the tower.     we were told you'd     been fatally wounded!     they were quick to assure     everyone i had been killed in the     blast, to ensure my death would     be considered "honorable.'     tragically, i survived.     yes, i'd been told that     as well. i chose to ignore to     it and continue living.     in fact, i feel stronger     than i have in years.     which leads me to suspect     that my "illness" may not have     been entirely... natural.     are... are you suggesting     the humans were not just alleviating     the illness, but supplying it?     i appreciate your     enthusiasm, aster..     this is true... this     is a call for war!     and it's all the more reason     why these outsiders should be     executed! nothing good comes     from people of other lands!     but you do not     have the authority to     make that judgement.

0572.jpg
"don't have     the authority?"     your highness, a lot has     changed since you were injured.     if you are not aware...     all three of our generals have been killed,     my father included. alaric's body is still being     recovered from the bottom of the gorge.     since the power vacuum, nearly every     officer on the island has been competing     to determine who should fill the void.     so far, i have defeated all challengers for     the honor of ascending to the position of     general, so that i may preside over this trial.     tell me, who has greater authority     to rule over these matters than ?     oh! well...     according     to alaric, that     would be...     keith.

0573.jpg
i don't understand...     oh, but that's just not true.     is this a joke?     keith keiser has no     rank or title.     when alaric discovered     alabaster's manipulation, he granted     keith's citizenship himself.     and since keith is the only living     he is not even     basitin to return from the outside world,     a legal citizen.     alaric decided his experience would     make him worthy of promotion.     that's not how it works!     think you underestimate     rank is not something you're     our wayward brother.     handed! it can only be earned through     but you are correct.     strength of body or will of mind!     and keith keiser has neither!     the law states rank     can only be eamed through     succession or combat.     however, if you can recall the     conditions of general alaric's death...     what... th...     that doesn't     count!     keith keiser defeated nikolai alaric     in single combat on the western bridge.

0574.jpg
won't accept it!     that challenge cannot be     considered legitimate! no one     witnessed it happen!     for all we know, the keidran     murdered alaric with sorcery!     i witnessed it!     erk! you?     yes, i was asked to     <excuse me,     document everything.     confused wolf….>     gave it to the wolf.     <do you happen to     still have the document     you were given?>     ‹huh?>     <i have no     "document.">     ‹well, unless you     this is insanity...     mean this thing.>     can't you people see     what's going on? alaric is making     mockery of our government just     482-7557f     to get keith into power!     leer hose then     dear snit     -mu     moreno laye,     on the 28th of august, year 482, i, lieutenant madelyn     we cannot     adelaide, witnessed a duel between keith keiser and     allow this!     nikolai alaric... and it was awesome! you should have     seen it at first. keith was al like 'oh noes!' but then he

0575.jpg
no, i cannot     allow this!     but.. it's my right...     keith keiser,j     challenge}     stand down,     alabaster.     you can't challenge     the boy while he's injured.     wouldn't be valid.     ..you're telling me this runt... this bastard     besides, he's     child of a westerner... the boy who helped     not taking away     murder my father just yesterday, is now     your position.     going to represent our entire civilization     ...he's not?     to the rest of the world?!     yep.     no, alaric knew     general keiser would be     challenged immediately, and     decided he would be better     suited to fulfill a new role,     as ambassador.     he will hold authority over     all foreign matters - including     your highness,     the fate of the outsiders.     how can you stand there     and allow this?     however, if you feel so strongly     opposed to my decision, you're more     than welcome to challenge me.     because i happen to agree.     our society cannot remain isolated     forever. the outside world is being is     stirred up more every day.     perhaps an ambassador     is just what we need.

0576.jpg
i... submit to the     there. you see?     wisdom of the king.     i told you everything     would work out.     i don't     understand...     how could alaric     though i'm sure     do all of this?     he planned     for many things.     he hoped it wouldn't     come to this.     do you think this     s the only document     he had made?     he couldn't     have known what     would happen.     the day you were banished, alaric devoted himself to avenging you.     he drafted hundreds of documents that exploited every loophole in     because you were     the system. it was the very reason he became a general. he was     his friend, and he wanted     obsessed with bringing you back, and the idea that those who had     to see you happy.     cast you out would one day be forced to acknowledge you.     but... why? why     do all this for me?

0577.jpg
dragon caves     ngh...     i think she's     finally asleep...     ugh, my back.     getting pounced on by a     dragon... i'll never complain     when flora does it again.     speaking of     flora, i have to get     where is that     back to her.     passage? is this     the... huh?     what is that?

0578.jpg
it's that girl from     the tavern. how did     she end up here?     hello?     why didn't you tell me     she was here from the start?     she needs a doctor! a     she was in your arms when     found you, but i don't know why.     maybe you tried to save her.     it's too late though.     i took care of her external     wounds, but internally, she is     slowly bleeding to death.     no... there must be something     i didn't know who she was. it wouldn't     i can do! she's still alive. if     have mattered anyway. no amount of     could just use my magic...     medicine can heal those injuries.     the best thing i could do     for her is induce sleep. her death     will be slow, but painless.

0579.jpg
i could...     i'd only need     trace, no!     to use a little...     i'd just need to-     you can't use     that power again!     but what else am i     trace, every time you     supposed to do? i can't     use that power, you draw from     just leave her to die!     your own lifeforce. that magic     always comes at a cost.     it will destroy you!     and if you take her     back to the basitin, they'll     only kill you as well.     you must learn to accept     that sometimes death is inevitable,     or you will be destined to return to a     path you've travelled before.     please... don't     sacrifice yourself.     i don't intend to     get myself killed.     but i remember enough     of yesterday to know she     risked her life for me.     i couldn't live with     myself if i didn't try to do     the same for her.

0580.jpg
sigh...     ..why?     huh?     what should do?     why do you     at the tower... from     keep helping me?     the basitin... and even the     first time saw you..     want to save     her... but what if     nora's right?     five years ago, when i was captured by . group of wolves while     trying to find my fiancé. they were going to sell me into slavery,     why?     i... i don't     but then... you came. you slaughtered them all... but spared me.     know…     you said wasn't one of them...     that was a different me.     i just want to help.     that | reminded you of "her."     ngh... can you     help me find a basitin     gr     il try.     named keith?

0581.jpg
i don't mind talking. the pain is     not great. i'm just afraid if i fall     asleep now, i... might not...     you shouldn't     be talking so much.     you need to conserve     your strength.     oh! er.     you mentioned you     okay, um...     were captured by keidran?     why would keidran enslave     their own kind?     nch     you really have no memories. eh?     it's a common practice in the slave trade     humans aren't technically allowed to cross     the border to hunt for slaves erg. sc they     hire wolves or dogs to do the job for them.     we foxes are a     common target.     and it's not as     most keidran races     though keidran don'1     don't hold any more loyalty     have their own slave     towards each other than they     trade as well.     do towards humans.     they do? i     had no idea...

0582.jpg
flora, the guards say     don't worry, we     our time is up! we can't     found the weapons!     stall any longer!     ah? weapons?!     none of us know now     to use     sword!     what's to know?     flora, i told you, we're not fighting     you just     the basitins. and you can't take on     swing it!     the whole army by yourself!     i can't     lift mine!     nya!     san     1     t     grr... just watch me!     excuse me! sorry for interrupting     i'm going out there!     your assault, but i've just been informed that     1... 2...     your friends have been released.     they'll be here shorty.     uh... thanks.     no prob.

0583.jpg
2     e     your highness, i     must protest!     the slaver can understand,     enough, general.     and maybe even the keidran spy,     keith keiser explained     but releasing the templar?     that the human was just as     manipulated as we were.     i saw the chains and the     look in his eyes, and i'm inclined     to believe that. he was a man     possessed by evil magic.     now let it go.     you saw all the destruction he     caused first-hand! he cannot be     allowed to go unpunished!     yes, sir. shall we do the same     for the vixen he is carrying?     huh? me?     we've just received word     that a human has been spotted     on the outskirts of the city.     should we apprehend him?     human? trace?     what?!     uh... no, just escort him     to the ship, i guess.

0584.jpg
meanwhile...     say... isn't that your     boyfriend out there?     ...and then they     just started leaving.     have no idea why,     but it seems like they're     letting us go now.     huh.     seems like     he's leaving too.     zen, if you use that     keith, wait!     word one more time i-! hey!     where's he going?!     what's going on?     i don't have time     o explain! just get to the     ship. i have to go!     but my... i can't!     the others would... arg!     get back here!     there he goes...     sigh... what     do i do now?     <to be     fair, i didn't     expect it     woah! hey,     from you,     nat, who's the huge     either.>     basitin lady?     that's probably the "king"     i mentioned earlier. didn't expect     him to be a woman, eh?

0585.jpg
really? your scent     suggests otherwise, but     i could be mistaken.     our noses are not as     sensitive as yours.     er, yeah!     you must be     mistaken.     at least that's what i'd say if     i didn't already know four females     were treated at the infirmary.     it's not that hard to figure     out we're missing one.     w-what do     d'oh!     you mean? i'm..     totally a guy.     so, erm... don't     of course!     suppose you're going     blarg!     o tell anyone?     but i am     curious...     keidran culture is     i'm not pretending!     something we do not make     but... it's a long story...     efforts to understand, and     feel it is a shame.     s there a reason     why you pretend     to be male?     well, perhaps you can tell me.     and perhaps i might be too busy to     correct the error in our records.

0586.jpg
look, laura!     we're almost there!     erg... not sure how     long can keep going...     she's getting heavy...     ...laura?     strange though... i     don't feel her weight at all     through my left arm...     ...she's not going     to make it, and i can't     help her at all...     i'm sorry, laura.     it's all my fault. i should     be able to do more.     i'm sorry...     don't be...     don't live with regret. i     laura!     spent my whole life dwelling on...     what could have been.     wouldn't wish i     on anyone else.     don't...     ngh... i only hope     did not cause the same     feelings of regret for-     k-keith?

woah woah     woah!     don't jump to     conclusions!     well.     is there?     there... there could be a     perfectly reasonable explanation     for why we're traveling with a     keidran soldier...     traitors! i     we must     knew it!     stop them!     no... let them go.     we must continue     our mission.     run!     master seer? but     they may be spies...     they are of no     consequence. continue     the march.     ..very well.     hey!     alright men,     have... you     let's keep-     been there this     wait...     whole time?     it's... rather     awkward knowing i've     been... riding you.

0598.jpg
meanwhile...     how interesting...     thank you for sharing     your story with me.     i can see now why     you'd be uncomfortable     vonn     with the way you are.     but have you ever     considered that strength     and femininity do not     necessarily have to be     mutually exclusive?     that's easy for you to say.     ah, that is     you're king of the basitin!     unfortunate.     here, it's just your ability that     but if i'm not     matters to your people.     mistaken...     it's not the same     with keidran... or at     least us wolves.     doesn't matter how strong     you are; if you're born a woman,     that's all my people ever see.     you are no longer     among your people.     ah...     have enjoyed this     guardsman, we've     discussion, but i am afraid must     finished. please see natani     get back to my duties.     back to his ship.     i'll make sure     you're seen out.     clink!     yes, ma'am!

it looks like pretty     much everyone's here.     i've heard we're departing soon.     are we missing anyone? where is     keith, and the lovely ms. laura?     ngh...     let's just     get inside. i'll     explain.     ...gone?     ..that poor girl...     "keith"!     i had hoped we'd     all gotten out of this     unscathed.     keith…     not here?     i gave her to keith,     but i'm not sure where     he went after that.

0601.jpg
oh, sorry natani.     flora, do you think     <here, natani,     you could...?     i'll help translate     for y... huh?>     sniff     ‹odd... something     snife     smells... strange...>     erk!     <gah! what is that?     of course.     are you wearing cologne?     it's burning my nosel>     ‹heheh, yeah, l...     accidentally spilled a bottle     of perfume on myself before     was sent back here.>     <um, maybe you should     just... translate from over there,     while i stand out here.>     <as much as i appreciate     king's perfume, i'm not going     to put all my trust in it>     um... okay...     mister trace...     is keith going to be     the whole reason we     returning here?     came to this island was to     return keith home.     i don't know,     kathrin.     we'll have to wait     and see, but... i'm not sure     ae     he's coming back.

0602.jpg
later that evening...     hmph. there you are kei-     ...alabaster.     general keiser. i should have     you'll be pleased to know     known you'd still be here.     that i've petitioned the king     for leave of the island.     i'm aware. i've     already advised her     majesty against it.     thought you of     people would want     to see me gone.     or are you just     objecting to any action     take out of spite?

0603.jpg
and that title is     "ambassador" isn't it?     it's my job to visit     other nations-     at the behest     of your king!     not because     you want to escape     no, it's not spite.     your problems!     you don't deserve     your title, but it's done,     and i accept it.     you're an adult now,     keith. you can't just fold and     run when life gets hard.     your experience     living among outsiders was     what got you that title.     experience our people     are going to need if recent     events with the templar are     a sign of things to come.     her majesty decided     to approve your leave,     against my counsel.     sigh...     regardless, it's     not my decision.     i hope one day     here.     you find where you     really belong.

0604.jpg
ding!     ding!     um... general     keiser... sir?     we... we've     finished.     the ship is finished being     resupplied and... everything else     was done as you asked.     the men tried the     5     best they could to adhere     to keidran ritual.     i...i'm sorry     for your loss.     yes, i'm sure.     i have to bring     i owe it     laura back...     to her...     i know this is a     difficult time, but we are     your people. i... we could     help you through it.     are you sure you want     to leave so soon?     i understand, sir.

0605.jpg
ding!     dingi     ngh!     there they go.     ...he's not coming     back, is he?     hmph, we should     be so lucky.     good riddance.     a storm is     brewing in the north.     there may soon come     don't be so sure     a time when we will be the     ones to come to him.     we've seen the last     of our wayward kin.

0606.jpg
below deck...     wow!     look at all this stuff     the basitins gave us!     well... gave keith' anyway.     suppose they want to show     support for their general.     ah, here's     the manifest.     aw... i'm hungry...     let's see... 100 kg of food     i didn't get to eat anything     200 litres of water     before we set saill     3 crates of wine...     weapons, armor,     clothing... formal     ankle coverings?     various tools and     supplies, medicine,     lamp oil, and spices.     ...kat, get out     of the food.     we've got plenty of     our own supplies without     taking from keith's!     come on, let's     see if the others are     ready for dinner.     end.

twokinds     chapter fourteen     mutiny

0608.jpg
what do you     i'm sorry, flora. i     mean 'no'?!     told you, i'm not willing     to release them.     why not?!     they stuck their     neck out for you!     they could have     easily taken this ship for     themselves and ran when     the basitins said so.     but they didn't. they     risked their freedom for     you and the others!     flora, i can't just     release a slave every     time he does what he's     supposed to do.     again, i apologize,     but you knew what     business i was in     when you agreed to     come aboard.

0609.jpg
alright, if     it's just business,     then finel     we'll buv     them!     flora... even if     intended to sell...     know trace     doesn't have enough     on hand to afford even     my answer has     one of them.     to still be no.     tsa     i'm out     of here...     oh, alright.     wait up!     i can't believe you!     you actually had me     fooled for : while into thinking     you really did care for keidran     in your own weird way.     but you really     are just a perverted     hypocrite!

0610.jpg
grimraaaah!     risul     hey! calm down,     evals! you're going     to hurt yourself!     calm down?!     why should i?     crashe     for the first time     in four years can finally     think for myself againl     there's no magic     constantly controlling     my every action!     but any day now     eric's going to figure it     out and put it back, and     we'll lose our chance     for freedom forever!     so how can     you be so calm?!     what? so are     saying you enjoy     being a slave?     evals, it's     no! you know     different for me!     don't. it's just... it's     more complicated.     i was born into     slavery. unlike you, i     don't have any place     to go back to!     it's not complicated     at all! you'd just come     back with mel

0611.jpg
you don't     understand!     i've lived my whole     life among humans.     human cities... human     music... human foods...     it's all i've ever known.     the life of a keidran...     it's not that     living on the land in a tribe...     simple for mel     it's entirely foreign to mel     can't just run out into the wilderness to live     among wild keidran. i have no survival skills. i     don't know keidran customs or traditions. i can't     am a keidran, but     even speak the keidran language very well!     my culture is human.     i would not survive!     want to be free, but... i     also want to continue working     and in living in the human cities     i've always called home.     well. i'm sorry to burst     your bubble, mike, but your     dream's a fantasy.     humans and keidran living     together will never happen. they'll     never accept us as equals.     so you'd better make     up your mind who's side     because i'm not going     you're on, and soon...     t     to wait around for eric to     remove my will again!

0612.jpg
meanwhile...     it's not fair!     snnrrk!     womph!     flora, relax. we'll     think of something.     nngh..     how can that bastard     be so ungrateful?     can't you do     anything, trace?     <can you     understand what     they're arguing     about?>     can try talking     dunno. some-     with him, but i     thing about slaves.     don't know what     "morning, by the     else we can do.     way. coffee?>     good

0613.jpg
damn.     my favorite robes are     really falling apart.     ouch. maybe you     could try asking one of     the girls if they can sew     it back together?     hm, i suppose     it's worth a try.     i don't have much else     in the way of clothes.     shoot! targets     are moving! here,     hold my mug!     gotta go before they     spot me. i'm planning     to strike tonight!     u     oh! okay,     good luck!     one change later...     ngh, i really     could use some     ?!     coffee, though.     ...real coffee, not     the ethereal kind.     hey, you!     'bout time     you woke up. i've     huh?     got a proposition     for you...

0614.jpg
aaaall i said was... if     someone happened to cause     some sort of dispute...     and it was either     us or the humans...     t     so let me get     this straight... you     want me to help     you mutiny?     hey! not     so loud! never     theoretically     said that!     speaking... who would     you side with?     now before you     answer, consider...     i'm a dog, you're a     wolf. they're practically     the same thing!     if you could convince him,     we could easily hypothetically     overtake the ship.     so what do     you say?     and your short     friend... he's a non-     human too.     not interested.     alright, fine!     i've got enough     just... forget about     to worry about...     what i said, then!     but if the slaves     really are planning     to revolt...     what?!     b-but... we're     your own kind!

0615.jpg
i really should     do something about     that, but- mrrf? i smell     food... coffee...     oh, hey! good     morning, natani!     hungry?     you're just in     time for second     breakfast, if you     want some!     uh, yeah, sure.     that'd be great.     say….     you wouldn't happen     to know how to sew?     my robes are     but, if you give me     pretty torn up.     some time to clean up,,     pi see what i can do!     oh? let     me see!     hm... yeah,     it's pretty bad...

0617.jpg
hm... these     bandages...     h-hey! what do     you think you're doing?!     don't mess with that!

0618.jpg
oh, sorry,     sorry! didn't hurt     hurt me?     you, did i?     your bandages... they     are for wounds you received     ript     at the tower, right?     is that why you     didn't want to remove     your robes?     natani! being injured is     er... yeeees!     nothing to be ashamed of!     that's the reason!     what if you were to     get an infection and no     heh heh.. heh...     one knew about it?     you should let me     have a look just in case!     no no! it's     healing just fine!     swear!     c-can you please     just finish sewing so l     can get out of here?     but... i know     some first aid.     i just want     to make sure     you're okay.

0619.jpg
so... you're both a     cook and a seamstress.     well... sort of.     do you really know     i've read up on it, anyway.     medicine, too?     that's how i've learned a lot     of what i can do.     reading?     oh yeah!     ever since eric taught me how     to read, i've loved learning about     all sorts of interesting things.     cook books,     apothecary journals,     magic scrolls... it's     all fascinating!     i.. never learned     how. to read, that is.     not much, anyway.     really... huh.     it wasn't exactly a     priority growing up.     oh, you should!     and they aren't all     educational, you know!     there's also so many     books on people and places     from all over the world!     would you like     me to help teach you?     it's great to be able to     there's so much to be     experience it all, only     gained from them.     through stories.

0620.jpg
hey spots... have you     ever thought about going out     and experiencing those places     in your books for yourself?     anyway, if you     ever want lessons, i'd be     more than willing!     huh?     what do     you mean?     i mean... have you     ever wanted to be free.     you know, free to go do     whatever you wanted...     ..experience whatever     you wanted.     ...kat?     oh, um... i...     i haven't really     thought about it.     i should get back lo     patching you up!

0621.jpg
meanwhile...     flora, please     promise i'll     don't be upset.     work something     i'm going to     out with him.     go talk to eric.     thank you,     trace.     ah! well...     i... i hope     you can talk some     sense into him.     flora, is there     something wrong?     ever since we     ...it's me,     left, you've been     isn't it?     distant.     you know     you can tell me     anything.     it... it's     nothing…     i'm just     concerned.     huh?

0622.jpg
it's because i lost control     then what?     again, at that night at the tower.     let you down again.     no! it's not that.     is it the hand?     that wasn't your     fault. the templar made     i can tell every time you     you change like that!     look at me that something is     bothering you. what is it?     it's... i'm not     flora, it's     sure...     alright.     whatever it     is, you know you     can trust me.     i've been thinking a lot,     too, since that night...     the more learn about     my past, the more i've come     to realize how much better     off i am now without it.     i used to want to     remember. but being told     just made me realize the     terrible person i'd been.     i understand now that     losing it all was the best     thing to happen to me.     so i've decided i'm not     going to let myself do anything     to put us at risk anymore.     w-what do     you mean?

0623.jpg
i mean i'm done trying     to chase down my past.     the templar, black     magic... there's no point in     dwelling on it anymore.     it's time i started     thinking about the present, and     doing what i can to put things right.     starting with the slaves.     i'm headed to     talk with eric.     don't worry, flora.     one way or another, i'll     make him see reason.     they'll leave this ship     as free men, and we can all     head to lyn'knoll together.     how does     that sound?     ... thank you,     trace. i'd like that.     . there's just one     thing i have to take     care of first, flora.

0624.jpg

0646.jpg
i'd never do     that to you. care     well obviously     about you...     not special enough     to change the fact that     i'm still your slave,     just like them!     and you     don't care about     the others?     w-what?!     kat, what are you saying?     that... it's not the same!     you've never expressed any     the collars are necessary     unhappiness with me before.     for those two, but you know     where is this coming from?     you're special to me.     maybe i've been foolish. i think     a part of me has always hoped one     day... you'd care enough...     i'm not unhappy with     you, eric! i didn't want to     bring it up like this...     ever since you rescued     me from your brother, i've     been grateful to you.     you've always been so     kind to me, but... i want     that i wouldn't     to be more than just     have to ask.     your servant.     kathrin...i never thought...     why haven't you ever talked to     me about this before?     i- i don't know...     clunk!

0647.jpg
never realized...     mean, never     r-really?!     even considered that     you might want...     oh, kat...     this is something     need to... think about.     and the     but of course... if freedom     others? what     is what you want... i guess     about them?     can work something out.     eric! haven't you ever     i... i don't know.     considered that maybe     this is too much! i     the fire was just an     need... time to think!     accident all along?     and i can't think     while the ship might     still be in danger!     that it was no     one's fault?     oh, but first, allow me     she's right!     to introduce myself!     it was an     accident!     w-what?     who the...     though, it     the name's madelyn     may have been     adelaide, but my friends     my fault...     call me maddie addie!     nice to meet 'cha!

0648.jpg
...what?!     oh, it wasn't     very hard!     i'm small, and     there weren't many     people around.     we- i mean just     walked right on board     before you left and     hid in a barrel.     where the hell     did you come from?     you know, for a ship     how did you get     this size, you sure don't     have a lot of crew...     on my ship?     so it was     you who set my     ship on fire?!     -it wasn't     on purpose!     someone left a lanturn     on top of my barrel. when     lifted the lid to leave, it     came crashing down!     was putting it out     when heard running     and, well... panicked.     but now you know it was     all just an accident! no one     the brig     needs to be blamed, and     there's no hard feelings!     right?     al 7 3     clank!     ....r-right?     aw...

0649.jpg
well...     amru...     i suppose that     settles that.     eric, you're not just     gunna keep her locked     the saboteur     up forever, are you?     has been caught.     she's just a kid.     even a young basitin     though i'm sure you     can be dangerous.     can see why what i did     was necessary.     she stays as long     as necessary, until we     know why she's here.     but questioning     comes later. one problem     at a time...     please, for now, return     to your rooms until things     can be sorted out.     i... will allow     your collars to stay     off for now.     mike, evals, i suppose l     was wrong. you two didn't have     trace, can you meet     anything to do with the fire.     me in my cabin? i think     it's time to negotiate.     and... maybe     over-reacted..     just a little.     uh, alright.

0650.jpg
trace, i'm not     sure if you're aware     what? why? what     of this, but...     templar laws have,     kind of evil person would     in recent years, made it     make a law like th... it was     a crime for slave traders     me. wasn't it?     such as myself to free our     slaves voluntarily.     .yes.     if mike or evals were     ever caught by the templar in     the future, and it was discovered     that i released them...     well...     let's just say it could     potentially put me or my     technically, it's illegal     family at great risk.     to even sell to someone     knowing they intend to     have no desire     release the slaves.     to see the inside of a     templar dungeon.     however, for kathrin's     sake... i am willing to take     that risk if you are.     on one condition: it has     to be a legitimate trade.     we will go to the village     of edinmire, near the tiger     border, and i'll document     that i sold the slaves.     after that, we can     all go our separate     ways from there.

0651.jpg
well? well?!     what did     he say?     he... agreed. he     said could buy them     and set them free.     really?!     yeah, he even gave     me the keys to their cuffs.     erki     trace, knew     you could do it!     oh! can i be     the one to tell them?     pleeease?     0-of course! though,     i didn't really do anything.     think what kathrin said     is what got to him.     oh, speaking of kat!     can't wait to tell her, too!     i mean sure, it's not going     to be much different for her,     but still, i'm sure she-     flora,     wait!     no, no!     it's not that.     huh?     eric... eric     didn't agree to     sell kathrin.     w-what? you     mean he's not going     he just told me     to set her free?     it was something he     had to do himself.

0652.jpg
kat! there you     are. we should talk.     oh eric,     thank you!     i've agreed to let     mike and evals go.     that makes     me so happy!     really?!     as for you... well,     i'm glad!     you were born into my     family, not bought. so...     i can free you directly.     and i will.     but there's     more.     it's something     i should have said     a long time ago.     what you said     you've always     made me realize     been like a sister to     how unfair i've     me, and i love you.     been to you.     you've always been     more than a slave to     me, but it took what     you said to make me     realize it myself.     like... a sister?     so i want you     to know i feel the     same way..     yes! and now     it's time i acted like     you do?!     the brother i am.     it doesn't     matter what you     i'm just...     or i am.     so happy.     we grew up together,     and no matter how     different we are...     always consider     you family. nothing will     ever change that.     ...a-are you     alright, kat?     ...yes. l...     i'm fine.     end.

0663.jpg
er... nevermind.     what are you     up to?     oh, well... ever since     island, flora's been acting     kinda... distant with me.     she's been going to bed     early each night and hasn't     undressed with me around     in the last few days.     i guess what happened     al the tower - my... recent     but i've decided to     outburst - scared her.     turn over a new leaf!     i'm going to show her     that i care, and i thought i'd     start with breakfast in bed.     so i'm down here trying     to learn how to cook!     unfortunately. either     my cooking skills were lost with     the rest of my memories...     i don't know.     or i never had     any to begin with.

so, how are you     i'm fine.     feeling, keith?     my eyelid was split     open, but the eye itself is     okay. right now it's swollen     shut, but it should heal.     my ear's damage is     mostly superficial, though     it'll probably be left with     permanent crook.     well, that's     good, at least.     okay! i     understand.     -; cu     by the way,     listen, if you ever     your food is on     want to talk about... you     fire again.     know, what happened...     gah!!     i said     i'm fine.     if you really     want, i could just     cook it for you.     no, no! i appreciate     the offer, but i want this     to come from me.     asshhh!'     well, at least let me     give you some advice.     in case you forgot, flora's a     carnivorous tiger. i don't think     you need to worry too much     about cooking the steak.

i think it's time     we're outnumbered,     for a tactical retreat.     and we've lost the     element of surprise.     and with this     new development, we     well, boys...     it's been fun.     we could still     need to reassess the     take them.     situation for now.     but i think it's time     i take my leave.     hey! you're not     going anywhere!     hmhm...     damn it!     wanna know the     that little...     great thing about     where did     illusions?     she go?!     guys, i... i     don't feel so...     ungh..     i've already left.     raine?

0680.jpg
damn it, we     almost had them! if     only you'd brought more     darts, or a bow, or...     with what money,     brother? in case you     forgot, we failed our     last mission.     our only bow went up     n flames, and i haven't     and even that     worked in a month.     wasn't enough. i had to     spend all of last week's     spent every last     meal money as well.     coin from this mission's     advance on those darts     and the crystals for     i... i didn't realize     your illusions.     things were so bad.     didn't want to worry     you, so i tried to keep it out     of your mind... literally.     but... things have     been rough back home.     if we don't succeed with     this mission... well, i...     but we will!     so tomorrow, when     it's just the two of them     they're exhausted and     now. the poison in those darts     weak... we'll strike!     was weak, but without an antidote,     they won't be waking up again.     with two - possibly three - down,     they're not going anywhere.     and i doubt those guys will     be getting any sleep tonight.     but for now, let's     get some rest.

snrk...     1zz     trace?     hm? oh,     there he is!     oh, good     morning, flora.     ..you're     i think trace was     up quite early     hoping he'd be finished     today.     before you were up.     he wanted to     have breakfast     ready for you.     yes, well...     aw, poor guy.     when i woke up     and saw that trace     hadn't come to bed,     i was a bit worried.

0683.jpg
well, trace seemed to     so, is everything     be under the impression     alright between you     that you've been acting     two, flora?     distant with him lately.     huh? why     do you ask?     i can understand if     you're a little wary because     of the hand thing...     no, no, it's     not that.     besides, i should     be the one asking you     it's just that...     how you're doing.     um... it's nothing.     after what happened     on the island... l'm     so sorry, keith.     ....ahuh, right.     we're your     friends, and we're all     ¿cau     here for you.     no, it's okay.     thank you.     if you ever want     to talk about it...     i know it's something     i should talk about. just...     not right now.     you know...     i don't think i've     properly apologized     to you, flora.     um...     1 - i'm sory,     i shouldn't have     a-apologized?     brought it up.     what for?

0684.jpg
is this about     what happened to trace     on the island?     no, it's not...     well, yes, but not     just that.     ‚zl     there's just some     things i have to get     off my chest.     after laura... was very bitter towards keidran.     all keidran. from the very beginning, i... i said     lot of cruel things to you... and about you.     i hated you the first time we met. because of what     you were... and how much you reminded me of her.     but being forced to travel with you     changed me. it opened my eyes again.     i need you to know     how thankful i am for that,     and how sorry i am for the     things i've said.     you made me re-evaluate my opinion of     keith..     keidran, and realize what an ass i'd been.

0685.jpg
before laura. died, there     were so many things i wanted to     tell her... so many things i wish i     could have done differently.     i wanted to let you     keith!     know how felt because... l     don't want to leave behind     any more regrets.     ngh... i'm not     making any sense.     just forget +     eh!     i understand.     and i forgive you.     what you did before,     she's right,     it doesn't matter. you're my     well...     keith.     friend, keith! please... don't     pull away from us.     um...     trace,     you're awake!     we all have     things in our past we     regret. i of all people     can relate to that.     but we're     friends.     and we're here for     you. while we can never     take back the things we've     done, together we can try     to make it right again.

0689.jpg
keithl     this isn't master-grade     sorry! sorry!     magic here. i never took a class     i... i didn't know     in illusion or anything.     they were still-     this is pure     make-it-up-as-you-go     spellcasting.     and guesswork     it's fine! i know     magic is very inefficient;     you didn't mean it.     burns through what little     let's just... pretend     mana i have quickly.     that didn't happen.     like said, it's still:     work-in-progress.     these crystals were     eh, it's stupid.     never meant to be charged     over and over like this.     my robes went     up in flames during     but..     the ship fire, and-     fire?! wait,     hopefully it'll be enough.     what fire?     mike's convinced, but i'm     not so sure about kat.     oh, right. man,     you really did miss     a lot, didn't you?     huh? kathrin     caught you too?     well, i'm not going     anywhere for while. so     what happened?     you want, i'll fill you in while     seems like missed     i try to fix these problems.     a lot yesterday.

0690.jpg
...but then i had the     idea to suffocate the fire by     removing all the air!     oh... and then some     other stuff happened and     and it worked!     the slaves were set free.     but by then my clothes     were on fire, so i wasn't     there for that part.     thanks to     yours truly, the ship     was saved!     -pop!     damn it!     alright, zen,     how long was that?     natani... do you...     want me to leave?     ..what?! that's     half a minute less     than last time!     it's still too     unpredictable!     huh? …oh...     sigh...     and to be honest...     no. not unless     i'm glad for the company.     you want to.     you know, i was worried     yesterday, when you didn't     leave your room at all.     yes! i mean, if you     hadn't noticed, there's     knew when i let     you…     not a whole lot of people     you're probably     you in that the spell     were?     here i can talk to.     the closest thing     have to a friend on     wouldn't last.     this ship.

0691.jpg
i guess that's kinda     yeah...     sad considering we've     tried to kill each other     more than once.     right?     a-anyway...     if there's ever     anything i can do     for you, i'm here.     natani... do     you remember when     y...yes?     we first met?     you and your brother     attacked us. you shot me     with an arrow.     could you     keith... i...     do it again?     even if i could..     it's not a     good idea.     but... right before     then... do you remember     i'm sorry, keith.     what you did?     can't. not that.

0692.jpg
when my parents died...     one of the reasons i pursued     magic was because i wanted     to bring them back.     i was naive, but i think     that's why a lot of people     get into magic. to change     what can't be changed.     years later, while     perfecting the spell, i tried     testing it... on myself.     but i was so young when i lost     them, and it was so long ago.     mom?     dad?     they... they had no face. i couldn't     remember their faces. their voices.     i know it wouldn't     i just wish i could     be the same for you.     say goodbye. even     but... trust me.     if it wasn't real.     it's just a illusion     made from memories. it's     not real, and it wont make     anything any better.     i know. i don't have     any delusions about     bringing her back.

trace, would you be so     kind as to make something     maybe maddie     should make her own     for our new friend to eat?     ruddy breakfast.     i'm sure she must     pe starving.     trace!     or better yet, she     can just eat the food     off the ground!     after all, she     put it there!     now trace, you said it     yourself, the food... isn't     argh...     really a big loss     nrgh... i know!     alright, fine, you two     but i still worked     win. just turn off the     hard on it!     puppy-dog eyes.     i know you did, dear,     and i appreciate it.     and don't expect     and i'm sure maddie     1 - i'm really     me to work as hard     is sorry. right?     sorry mr. trace.     this time around.     come on, maddie,     10 minutes later...     have a seat and let     uncle trace work.     alright,     here it is.     enjoy,     squirt.     trace... how...?     i... don't know.

if you feel you really     need it... i'll use my last     crystal to cast the heart's     desire spell on you.     alright, you     win... i'll do it.     but what about     sigh...     your disguise spell?     i guess can just     huh?     keep going with the "curse"     excuse for a while longer     and pretend i'm cured later.     but i wam you...     are you really     no matter what     sure you want me     says, or how real it     to do this?     seems, it won't be the     real laura.     it can't tell you     anything you don't     already know.     how long     will it last?     as long as you allow it to.     once i cast the spell, it'll draw     its energy from you, and won't     stop until you will for it to.     that's the danger of this     magic. the longer it's up the     more it will drain on you.     which is why, once     you've said your peace,     you must let her go.     i'm serious, keith. before     do this, i need you to swear     to me that you will release i     know... swear.     once it's all done.     just begin the spell.

0712.jpg
even as a young man, my father was gifted in     unlike typical illusions, his ability     magic. but what made him unique was not his     allowed him to physically become     power, but a natural ability that most mages     human, down to the smallest detail.     could never hope to learn, let alone master...     flawless transformation.     don't move,     human!     yeah, i know it's you,     cousin. i'm not an idiot. you,     on the other hand...     eek!     why do you keep doing     rose? roselyn!     this? sneaking off into that     i... i'm not a human!     human village is going to get     it's me, euchre!     you collared one day.     don't stab mel     you're not as clever     as you think you are.     oh no? i certainly seemed to     now / you'll excuse     fool the templar when i applied to     me, i need time to prepare     join their college in edinmire.     for my inauguration!     you... did what?!     are you insane? why     would you do that?!     rose, you know how much     magic means to me. think of all the     knowledge i could gain from them!     what the humans are doing with     magic is incredible. they have theories,     when the templar catch     formulae... their magic is an art! and their     you, the only thing you'll be     college s the only place i can learn it     getting is an execution!

0713.jpg
but rose was wrong - euchre was not caught.     in keidran form, euchre voluntarily arranged to become     in fact, i'm told he thrived at the college.     an indentured servant on a farm at the edge of town.     s     this gave him a place to rest outside the college, and     legitimized his presence in the village, on the off     chance he was ever discovered in his natural form.     it was at the college that euchre first met my mother, mary     hold on! you're telling me euchre     silverlock. she was not yet grand templar, but was well on her way.     never told your mother what he     don't know much of their relationship. my mother never went     was, even after they started     into detail, i think it was too painful for her. all i know is that she did     sleeping together?!     not know the truth of euchre even after they had become intimate.     yeah... she     had no idea.     that's kinda     messed up.     from what my mother described, euchre was a brilliant man, but     he was also... manipulative, and self-serving. i get the impression     he would have never told my mother the truth, if it hadn't been for...     master euchre! there you     are. i was told i could find you     in ms. silverlock's room.     oh, em... yes,     there's a keidran,     what is it, boy?     sir. it's calling your name     from the gallows.

0714.jpg
what's going     on, sirus?     euchre?     we caught this keidran     skulking around the edge of     the village using an adorable     little illusion charm.     unfortunately for her, the town     guards saw through it the moment the     spy opened her mouth. quite a strong     rural keidran dialect, you know?     ‹euchre, where are     you? please, help me!>     don't usually get wolves this far     east. unfortunately, no one on the field     right now are familiar enough with them     to perform a proper interrogation.     i-is this really     necessary?     what's     going on?     euchre, who is     this keidran? do     well, i considered holding off     you know her?     until a translator arrived, but this     seems easier. then again... imagine     what kind of things we might learn...     euchre?!     we're ready.     bring her up.     euchre...?     <no! i don't     understand!>     <euchre! help     me! please!!>     euchrel

0715.jpg
hangman,     stop.     eh?     what? may | ask...     why, headmistress?     if this keidran is a     spy as you say. i'd like to     forgive me, but you are     question her. i think she     not an interrogator, and i know     knows something,     you aren't fluent in keidran.     it's my duty     to handle spies,     not yours.     well... if that is     what you wish. however,     like i said, it will take quite     some time in order to find     someone who can-     thank you, sirus, but     am head of this college,     i wish to do     and i'll decide for myself     it myself.     what my duties are.     and as head mage, i have     ways of communicating     ...mary?     without using words.     i need to be     now do as     alone right now.     command.     euchre...     ...bastard!     ...as you say...     mistress.

0716.jpg
you lied to me...     r-rose? rose     this whole time!     is still alive?     don't pretend to care     now! i don't know which is     more disgusting     i don't know     what you're t     no! no more lies,     euchre! i questioned rose.     i looked into her mind. she     crasht     couldn't lie to me.     that you never planned to tell     me what you really were, or that you     were willing to sacrifice your own cousin     0 make sure it was never found out!     l-it's not like that!     he left me no choice!     it's sirus! he was     trying to trap me - to     he knew i couldn't be     gauge my loyalties.     caught connected with     magic-using keidran.     you had a choice! you     i never meant for any     you didn't seem     could have run! taken     her and left this place.     of this to happen. i wasn't     to care enough to     tell me the truth     trying to use anyone.     before bedding me.     all that time we     were together..     would i have     turned out any better     then why...     for me if i had?     why pretend     it's your people just     to care about     now who were preparing     me, if not to     lo murder an innocent girl     use me?     they simply suspected     of being a spy.     might not excuse what     you used her, just     wasn't pretending!     i... i just... hadn't plan     i've done, but are you honestly     as you used me.     for it to happen...     surprised i'd keep what i am     secret from you?

0717.jpg
so, then what     happened?     but... i don't know     if i believe that.     if she really     don't actually     wanted to, think she     know. all know is     could have had him...     that eventually, she     "removed" quietly.     let him go.     what? just     like that? why?     think a part     of her still loved him.     but maybe that's naive     well, i can     wishing on my part     only say what my     mother told me.     she claimed it was     because exposing him     might have ruined her     chances of being chosen     as grand templar.     no, i get that.     either way,     mean, i grew up an     am thankful for     orphan, but i can understand     my mother's mercy. as     the desire of wanting parents     you've probably guessed,     who don't hate each other.     by then she was already     though, i gotta     pregnant with me.     say... i wouldn't     blame your mom     acp     if she did.     it was a shock     for everyone.     my conception was made possible due to my     father's transformation. however... the gods do     my existence was kept a secret from almost everyone. a high     not look kindly on those who thwart their laws.     templar giving birth to a keidran would have been a scandal.     was bom cursed     inherited my father's gift but     i was given a locket to wear which kept my magic at bay, and     none of his control. i'm not sure which form i was bom     then sent to live in a cabin far away from civilization. there     with, but i was either a keidran from birth, or changed     were years of my childhood where i wouldn't see another     soon after, because i'm told the midwife fainted.     soul, save for my caretaker. it was : lonely time in my life.

0718.jpg
your mother     looking back, i think i     just... abandoned     understand now. i was a living     you for years?     reminder of what euchre did.     man, that's     she couldn't stand to have     rough.     me around, but at the same     time, i was still family. so she     kept me at arms length.     it wasn't so     bad, though.     my caretaker doubled as     my tutor, and once learned     you know it's kinda     how to read, i spent most of     funny. i didn't even know     my free time in books.     about my "inheritance" until     i was about 12 years old.     if you think you were surprised, imagine how i felt as     young girl when i accidentally stepped on my locket and     began sprouting fur. i'd never even seen a keidran before!     rainy, what's wrong?     knock     knock!     you haven't eaten anything     all day. let me in!     eeeeeeee-!     nol     keep away!     might eat you!     i remember being terrified, thinking i'd tumed into a     werewolf. i guess that's not too far off the mark, is it?     and... that's     we were sold into slavery by trace, but secretly released by the     about it.     years later, euchre helped     man i'd later learn was my father. mother enchanted one of my     trace lead a coup d'état against     shackles with the same spell as my locket, and then we escaped.     the templar, in exchange for     sparing mother's life.     look out!     trace used painful, forced     version of my father's spell - imperfect     transformation - to make my mother like     me. his idea of a cruel joke, i guess.     we became seperated while on the run,     and... that's when ran into you guys.

0719.jpg

0720.jpg
don't get me wrong     though, this is still     pretty weird for me.     a week ago, i could hardly     stand to be in the same room with     keidran, and now i'm sitting right next     to one having a casual conversation     while her tail is hitting my leg.     0-oh! sorry!     i've always had trouble     controlling that thing.     but you know, i still consider     myself human... i know i don't     look it right now, but i spent my     i'm still the     whole life raised as such.     same "raine" you     always knew.     oh, yeah, of course!     i know, i'm just saying... it's     yeah, i'll say. he drew     probably going to take me a     his sword on me three times     while to get used to this.     during the night saying i had     *finally turned on him."     i know in my head     who you are, but... seeing     but ya know, as much as i     a keidran, my body's first     enjoy seeing red actually question     reaction is still "enemy."     his actions for once, can we please     focus on healing the girls?     we've still got an     assassin out there.     rightl     where is he, anyway?     why hasn't that guy tried     attacking us again?     he doesn't have to.     he knows while there     are two of us down, we     can't go anywhere.     no point taking a risk and     fighting us all at once when     he can just wait it out.     this guy is     there's only us three,     devious... a real     and we can't leave the girls     professional.     alone, so we either split up     he's probably watching us     snnnmk!     or we starve.     right now, just waiting for     the perfect time to strike.

"basitin black magic."     and i owe him     debt. that's all     there is to it!     a debt, hm?     and there was also that time i caught the     woah woah woah!     two of you in the baths together. i didn't     know it at the time, but in hindsight...     wasn't implying you two     were doing anythingl     i just meant     it's obvious he'd     known then.     oh...     right... well...     anyway, keith's stuck     his neck out for me a lot.     he protected me when i     wasn't... in control.     he even risked his     own life for me.     and what have     h-hey! that was a misunderstanding! we ended up in the     ever done for     same bath by accident! and he was washing my back! it     him in return?     wasn't what it looked like! i don't even know why i let him-

0747.jpg
well... -the first     time we met was at     the inn, wasn't it?     i fainted... but     keith was there.     i don't know     how that proves     anything.     it does, because     that isn't right.     i'm sorry,     what?     keith, i know t     is hare     no!     no, she's     lying!     we met     once before.     something     only the real laura     would know.     you're lying     to protect me,     aren't you?!     tell them!     1- i can't!     laura, don't     do this to me!     tell the truth!     keith!     1 don't     know it!     tell them!!     please... just     show them...     please... i need     you to be real.

0748.jpg
laura... i     need you. i have     nothing left...     but you do.     you have them.     ( ,     0     your friends.     people who     care about you.     people who     love you.     you have     to, keith.     even if i were the real laura,     she wouldn't want to see you wasting     with them,     away for a few more days of life.     know you can.     she would want     you to live on.     don't know     if i can...

0749.jpg
no     i'm sorry. i've     been so stupid.     no, keith.     you're just in pain.     please don't stay     you've been in     bitter with the world.     pain for so long.     it's not what i... laura     would want.     and i'm so sorry     i added to it. but your     friends can help you.     keith…     yes, i get it. it's     time. i'm not ready,     but... i get it.     laura... you don't     have to pretend anymore.     i understand now.

0750.jpg
natani...     what do i do?     0     all you have     want... laura     to do is want it.     gone? but... how     can want that?     no, keith. it's about     what you need more. and     you know what that is.     keith, say it.     but you     have to admit it     to yourself!     you're right,     laura, you're right     i forgot for a while,     but... need to live.     you helped me to     remember that.

0751.jpg
i'm so glad.     as long as i know     i think you've     i'm not holding you back,     helped me too.     can be content.     laura...     la-uhh...     woah!     hey, gotchal     the drain of the     illusion is catching     up with you.     come on. i'm     taking you back     to your room.

0752.jpg
man, am i glad all     of that's sorted now.     ghosts, that's just what     we needed. hopefully, no     more drama crops up.     yeah...     -sniff     i hear ya.     well, on     lighter note...     i meant to say     earlier, but i see you     decided to open up     about the baby.     congrats!     wait... what?     you're     dang it, mikel     pregnant?!     fwap!     you mean you...     really didn't figure     that out already?     ...um, surprise?

thokinds (10 anniversary     reflections

0755.jpg
you were     right, flora.     getting out of     the cabin for a while     was a good idea.     sighs     yeah, this is nice.     after everything that's     been going on lately, all i want     to do right now is kick up my     paws and relax.     well, you've been     under a lot of stress lately.     you deserve it.     you know, looking     up at the stars like this, it     almost reminds me of the     first night we met.     do you remember     that night in the forest?     how could i forget?     it's the very first day l     have any memory of.     from my perspective,     that night was the first night     had ever experienced.

0756.jpg
that night, long ago...     oh, hey!     alright, that     you're still up. i didn't     should be enough     wake you, did i? i just left to     to last for now.     gather more firewood.     no. i've     been awake.     oh... okay.     so, um... since     we're both still up, there's     something i wanted to ask you     earlier, but... i wasn't sure if     it'd be rude to do so.     that guy from before     called you a "keidran."     is that the name     of your... species?     ...do you     really not know?     this isn't some elaborate     trick or something? playing     dumb to bring me back?     what? no, no!     c     i'm not trying to     "bring you back" anywhere.     was just curious.     all i know for sure about     keidran so far is that they have     what? we don't all     orange fur and stripes.     have... wow, you don't     know much, do you?

0757.jpg
okay, let me get this straight...     there are tiger keidran, wolf keidran,     dog keidran, and fox keidran...     right.     and then... rabbit     keidran, and lizard keid-     and fish keid no, no, no!     that's wrong. mean, yes, there are     supposedly merfolk in the sea and i had     heard stories from people about a species     of reptiles in the mountains... but none of     those count as keidran.     just canids and felids.     well... what's     the difference?     if both canids and     felids count as keidran,     why not the others?     the difference is     canid and felid keidran     are closely related.     the other creatures are more     primitive than our two species. they're     usually classified as beasts.... but then     again, so are keidran sometimes.     oh, and have i     mentioned basitins yet?     i'm so confused.     sighso     it's alright, trace.     the only ones     you'll need to know are     us keidran. all the rest     are either far away or     might not even exist.     well, i'm sure glad     i have you here to teach     and i can guarantee you'll     me about this stuff.     never have to worry about meeting     a basitin. they live far off on some     i'd be totally     weird island or something.     lost right now     oh... erm, you...     without you.     you're welcome.

0758.jpg
heehee! you     were so clueless!     hey! gimme a break! it was     my first day. i was experiencing     everything all over again!     well, you're lucky     i found your cluelessness     so cute, then, human!     crab     because that whole night     while you were asleep i was up     debating whether or not it would     be safer for me to just...     r-really?     ...eat'cha.     ...nah!     blargl     there's something     i wanted to show you!     oh, but that     reminds me!     huh? what is it?

0759.jpg
taadaal     hey! it's the shirt     i woke up in! i didn't even     know we still had it.     where did it     come from?     i found it crumpled     up at the bottom of     your old backpack.     stef.     da snie     urg... certainly smells     like it's been stuck down     there all this time, too.     say, how     come you stopped     wearing it?     what, you mean other     than that big templar emblem     right on the front?     well, have you seen     the back yet?     the victim     of one too many     of your pounces,     if i recall.     right... sorry.     really need to be     more careful with     my claws.

0760.jpg
hang on, hear     footsteps. someone's     coming up.     thunk     younk     hm?     oh, it's you!     oh...     evening, keith!     hey, you guys.     sorry, i didn't know     anyone else was up here     at this time of night.     i'm not... interrupting     anything, am i? i can     come back later...     nahl     we were just going through     some old stuff and reminiscing     about the early days.     what are     you up to?     huh, that's     coincidence.     in a way,     so was i

0761.jpg
i've been thinking     about letting...     about what you guys have     certain things go.     been telling me.     so i brought     up this.     ooo! it's the     bucket helmet!     what were     you going to do     with that?     you must know,     i was planning on dropping     it into the ocean.     you...     ...what?!     nirraaaohll     watch!     you can't     just throw away     or' buckety!     flora, do you even     know why i wore that thing     in the first place?

0762.jpg
wore it out of obligation, not choice.     the armor was my father's.     it was a condition of my banishment - to keep with     me, so that i would always remember what i'd done.     it worked. every night, i would look into my helmet and     see myself, alone. it was a constant reminder of what my     i spent my life     father had done, and how i could never truly be rid of him.     hating that man for     what he'd done.     and now it turns     out, my father was     never the monster i     thought he was.     he may not have     shown me any love, but     he loved my mother.     either way, i don't     deserve to wear this     helmet anymore!     and i     killed him.

0763.jpg
<keith, don't.>     <i saw you going up. i     figured you might be doing     something foolish.>     ‹natani? this     doesn't concem you.>     <i think it does.>     <i might not have     been around as long as     those two, but...>     < know you.>     the moment you     throw that helmet into the sea,     you'll turn around and beat     yourself up over it.     <and neither     <you might even     does it, believe     convince yourself that you     or not.>     somehow deserve it.>     <because i know for     ‹but you don't.>     a fact that you owe your     life to that thing.>     <if it weren't for that helmet, the day we first     <lights out,     met would have turned out much differently.     ya' long-eared     i would have aimed my arrow at your head.>     weirdo.>     <1, um... regret that whole... trying     to murder you thing, by the way.>     ‹it's okay, natani.>     <we're even, since i did     try the same thing at the inn.>     <... granted, i stopped     intentionally, whereas you failed     due to incompetence.>     <... regretting it less now.>

0764.jpg
<but i get what     you're saying.     <yeah, well, at the time     i would have been more     i appreciate that you     didn't take my head off     than happy to do so.     way back then.>     it wasn't exactly my     intention to spare you.>     <but yeah, like l     said, i'm... certainly glad     that didn't happen.     if i had known     at the time that     you were...     i mean...     i never imagined     that one day i'd...     um... well, you see... i     really like having you around     ...8-as a good friend, and...     stuff, so l->     brush     eep!     <it's okay,     natani.>     <| know.     and..>     <maybe you're     right about this thing.>

0765.jpg
yeah, keith,     he's right!     besides, think of all     the good times we've had     with ol' buckety!     oh no...     like that one time,     when i stole all your clothes     while you were bathing...     ...and then sent them     floating down the river as     payback for attacking me     that one timel     i knew i never     should have trusted a     bloody keidran!     i'll get you     for this, flora!     that wasn't     took me nearly     funny at all!     half an hour before     i got them back!     they went over     a waterfall!

0766.jpg
1 ch...     c     fine. since     you apologized.     and... i suppose l     can admit that it was,     in hindsight...     aw, come on     now, keith. don't be     mad at me.     i only tease you     out of love.     hmph!     look, i'm sorry. i     didn't mean to make you     feel uncomfortable.     ...just : tiny     bit funny.     that's the     spirit!     but honestly... i know     in the past you had a lot of     bad memories associated     with this helmet.     but things have     changed for you     since then.     you're no longer     banished and your father     you'll see things     wasn't a monster.     differently than you     and i think when you     did before.     look at it now...

alright, alright!     i get what you're     both saying. i'll keep     the dang helmet!     good!     <and now that that's     all settled, why don't you     two lie down and watch     the stars with us?>     ‹well...>     <| suppose i don't     have anything better     to do right now.>     <what about     you, natani?>     <eh, if you're going to,     then sure, why not?>     ...you know what,     flora? you were right.     this is nice.     end.

epilogue     hey, wait. since     we're all sharing...     there's something     i've always wanted     to ask you, trace.     hm? me?     sure, what?     what's the     deal with that blue     triangle you have     is it some kind     on your face?     of templar tattoo?     birthmark? a magic     seal, maybe?     what blue     triangle?

troleas     chapter seventeen     stranded

0770.jpg
well...     i've got     good news and     bad news.     the good news is     the girls are stable.     at least for now.     whatever the     assassin used, it isn't     killing them.     it's just... keeping     them asleep. and that's     the bad news.     without knowing exactly     what he used, there's nothing     i can do to help them.     i've tried some simple     remedies, but the sisters     just won't wake.     so in short, we're     totally boned.     we need a cure, and     the only one who might know     that isn't     it... is the assassin.     helping!

0771.jpg
rainel your mother was the     what we     need to do is think     former grand templar! you     up a plan!     must have powerful magic!     right?     a plan, from     you? now i know     we're doomed.     be careful not     to strain yourself.     shut it,     furball.     well, yes... i... i do     have magic, but like i said,     was never trained.     and it wouldn't     as long as i'm trapped     matter anyway.     in this keidran body, i'm stuck     with all the biological issues that     comes with being keidran.     i can't cast magic     without mana crystals!     this doesn't     "tum me human.'     this is a magic     suppressor. it keeps     my curse in check.     well, what about     but it also cuts off     this shackle thing?     my magical abilities.     it turns you human,     right? then you can use     magic without crystals.     if i managed to fix it,     i then wouldn't be able to     calizo     use magic voluntarily.     it's lose-lose,     either way.

well, alright,     okay, first, how?     maybe...     maybe the     we can't exactly     two of us could just     defend ourselves while     carry the girls?     carrying two women.     and raine can't     carry them. not     for miles.     second, where?     the nearest villages are     either the one that was destroyed     or the one who's neighbour was just     destroyed... by wolves.     which, if you hadn't noticed,     two of us currently are!     oh, believe     me, i've noticed!     i've also noticed i'm     the only one making any     suggestions here!     while all you do     is complain!     yeah? well so far my     complaining seems to be     about as effective!     would you two     maybe i wouldn't need     cut it out!     we're all tired and     to poke holes in your plans     stressed, but this arguing     if they weren't all stupid!     isn't helping any of us!     so knock it off!     hmph. fine.     whatever.     you do     that, fleabag.     i'll just stand guard     in silence, then, since     that's all i'm good for.     tchl keidran!     maybe if i'm lucky,     what did i     that assassin will have     do to deserve being     an extra sleep dart     stranded out here with     waiting for me.     these animals?

0773.jpg
"animal..."     mother was right.     once people see me like this,     but she also said if i tried     it's all they ever see.     hard enough, i could learn to     control it like euchre could!     so why isn't     it working?!     come on!     change backl     dummamble.     change     back already!     you really     are a moron, ya     know that?     i thought you     said you were going     to stay quiet.     do a     maybe you ought to     take your own advice!     maybe it'll help convince     her she'd be better off with...     raine's already uncomfortable     someone of her own kind.     enough being keidran without you     using keidran slurs around her!     h-hey!     she's not one of     wha-? she knows     your kind, no matter     how she looks!     i wasn't referring to her!     i only meant you and the     don't get     bastard hunting us!     any ideas!     somehow, i don't     think that's how she     interpreted it.     perhaps you     but fine, keep doing     should be telling     what you're doing.     her that, then.

welp... here we are.     is     wash     room     r-right... there it is.     alright, look. we both     knew this was coming. let's     not pretend otherwise.     now, i know     you'll want to say you     ...yeah...     can handle it...     but this is going to take     at least some effort... and you had     to take a break just walking down     the steps to get here.     i just don't want you     passing out and drowning     on me after all this.     so think we should     just act like adults here     and get it over with.     was     roon     right... yeah, l     guess we have no choice     not as though this is     but to go in together... for     the first time, after all...     safety reasons.     just the first time it hasn't     right! safety.     been an accident. so why does that     make this feel more awkward?

0793.jpg
a little cold,     don't you think?!     sorry!     splase     i think whatever     the tower did also had     an effect on the ship's     enchantments.     blegh!     don't worry. it's     slow, but once this rinse     is done, the bath should     have warmed up.     ...thanks.     natani... why     you know     are you doing all     what i mean.     this for me?     you've been acting     little different towards     w-what do     me since we woke up. more...     you mean?     open. it's nice, but... weird,     coming from you.     have i? yeah,     guess maybe     i have.     look, what     laura... the way she looked right at me - like she     does it matter?     was pleading for me to take care of him. don't     know... maybe was just imagining it, but...     i'm just glad you're     not dead, that's all! so     real or not...     i'm being nicer.     just don't get used to it!     once you get your strength     back, i won't go easy an     no. no     more evading.     huh?     natani, i need to     know... what's going     on between us?

0794.jpg
keith… do we really     have to do this now?     can't we just enjoy the     rest of the ship ride without so     much... emotional stuff?     mean, after everything     that happened earlier-     that's exactly why     i'm asking! i know, i just     lost laura, but...     well, the truth is, i've     been mourning her loss     for a long time now.     it made me a bitter     person for years.     but now...     because of your spell, i feel     like i finally have some closure.     like can move on now.     alright, i get that, but...     i just don't know what to say.     you want a     straight answer?     then fine. yes, there     is a... small part of me that...     has feelings for you.     but i can't tell if that's     really me... or the female body     making me feel that way.     um... i can't say for sure,     but considering you kissed me     back at the tavem, i think i might     tell me this, keith: we     question it even more.     had never ended up in the same in     bath that night we first met, and i was     still a guy to you, would you even     be asking me this right now?     we agreed not     to look into that

0795.jpg
i'm just saying, it's a little     i was under a     weird for a guy to kiss a friend     lot of stress, okay?!     out of the blue like that.     the tavern was on fire, you     had just saved my life from... well,     admittedly you, and after all that...     it was the heat of the moment!     well if you think     about it, we were in a     similar situation now.     i was under a lot of stress, the     ship was on fire apparently, and you     ended up saving my life earlier from     something that came from you.     but i know you wouldn't     like me suddenly kissing you     for no reason and saying it was     the "heat of the moment"!     well maybe i would!     y

0796.jpg
keith.     wait,     ..natani?     no, no, it's okay!     i know what you're     going to say.     i wasn't serious either!     you know me, i'd never just     up and... do that to you.     you know, not unless     you asked me to... which i     know you never would, so     it's a moot point.     heheh..     are... are     this is the part     you okay?     where you're supposed     to deny it too.     sigh...     then i'm     asking you.     asking me     to what?     in that case...

0797.jpg
n-natani, are you sure?     this seems so fast, maybe     we should wait until-     it's up to you, keith,     but it's now or never.     i know myself, and     in another minute, i'll try to     laugh it off as a joke.     okay, then.     if you're sure...     then i will.     tyump!     ready?     thump!     tyump!     thump!     y-yes?     tyump!     tyump!     was... was     that really it?     thumpi     tyump!     peck!     uh... i guess?

0798.jpg
was it that bad?     no! not bad,     it's just... after all of that     build up, i was expecting     it to be more...     i dunno... eventful?     momentous? just... anything to     help me sort out my feelings once     and for all, but it was just...     brief.     sigh, i know...     i tried, but i was     probably almost as     reluctant as you.     not that i didn't     want to, but...     i think deep down...     i guess i can see     even knowing your secret,     now how you must feel, at     i really have seen you as     least a little, kissing someone     one of the guys!     you view as a guy.     it must have     so this change     was a bit strange     *one of the guys"?     been really hard for you.     sorry it ended up being     for me too.     disappointing.     keith...     huh- mmphl     well it wouldn't     hurt to try again!     mmph...     cunk!

0799.jpg
meanwhile..     you hit him     pretty hard. the rock     may have given him     a concussion.     s00000...     how long do     you think he's going     to be out?     well i had     to be sure he'd     stay down.     yeah, better     safe than sorry.     still, we need him to     tell us what kind of poison     he used on the girls, so he     can't die on us yet.     raine! don't go     complimenting the guy     trying to kill us!     you know, i expected     i know. i'm not     an assassin to be a lot scarier     being serious.     in person, but he's actually kind     of cute, for a wolf boy.     it's just nice to finally     feel safe again! we make     well, we're friends     a pretty good teamn.     with you, but i don't think     sythe and will     especially now that     friends!     you two have put aside     your differences.     alright, alright!     for now...     we're all     friends now!     huh?     mete!     hel     acl     raine,     you're-!

0800.jpg
you're changing     again! look!     huh?     i am?     am! i'm     finally turning back     into me again!     it's just like mom     said, if i stay calm, i can     change back even without     the suppressor!     this is the     best day ever!     well... it was.     sigh...     back to being the only     keidran in the group again.     it was fun while it lasted.     now for     the rest!     aw, come on!     what's wrong now?!     i can't be stuck like this!     it's worse than before!     hey, look on     the bright side, at least     you don't have the face     of a nmph!     what?     nothin'!     uh..     caught it     raine?     that time.

0801.jpg
it... it's really     sigh….     not that bad, you know?     if you ignore the legs, it kinda     looks like you're wearing     keidran costume.     heh. yeah.     i'm sorry for     spoiling the mood.     i'm still glad we're     safer now.     it's just a little     frustrating, is all. but you     guys don't have to worry     about me, i'll be okay.     if you're sure.     well, i don't know     how long that guy's     going to be out.     yawni     but this is the first     chance we've had to get     some sleep. i think now's     a good a time as any.     red, why don't you     and raine get some rest.     we'll take first watch.     "we?'     i don't think so. how     about / watch him while     you get some sleep.     what?!     seriously, after all that     happened, you still don't trust     me? because i'm a wolf?     no, i don't trust     you because you just     referred to that rodent     like it's a person.     hey, boysl hello?     hey! you     i'm still here, and     leave mrs. nibbly     i've actually slept recently.     out of this!     why don't / watch him?

0802.jpg
raine, i don't think     1 watching him alone is     such a good idea.     mean, no offense,     but you're already hurt,     and if he broke out...     i know. you're right     i certainly wouldn't stand     a chance in a fight.     but if one of you guys     falls asleep on watch, there     won't be any fight at all.     she's got     good. once he does,     point.     we can trade his life for the     name of the poison, and then     be long gone from here.     hmph, yeah,     i guess.     right! don't worry, us     girls will hold the fort. isn't     that right, mrs nibbly?     alright. i don't     like it, but i agree, this     is the best choice.     oh no,     don't worry,     not you too!     here.     i'll call out if he     wakes up.     there's something     off about that thing.     hey...     once we have what     we're not     we need, i'll take him away     really letting that     from here and...     guy go after this,     are we?     *let him go."     switch     of course not!     even without any     but raine doesn't     weapons or crystals,     need to hear that.     he's still dangerous.

0803.jpg
i shouldn't feel     bad. know they're just     trying to shield me.     it's just a little     hard not to feel hurt.     might be a little naive     sometimes, but i understand the     situation we're stuck with.     it would be a bad     idea to give this guy another     opportunity to try and trick us     & gr     again in the future.     and i'm all too aware     of how dangerous someone     with magic can be.     still, i wish there     meanwhile...     was another way.     wow.     even someone like     now that was...     this guy must have friends or     something.     family out there waiting for him     to come back home.     i wonder where     they might be.     yes... quite.     i am never going     to hear the end of this from     zen whenever he decides to     finally wake up today. up     thank goodness his     mind still seems | be asleep     at the moment.

0804.jpg
so...     where do     we go from     "from here?"     here?     w-well, i was thinking     we should probably go down     to our usual sparring spot!     get to work building     your strength up before we     hit the mainland again.     natani, you     know what i mean!     are we... are the two     of us in a relationshi     mmmgh..     don't say it!     mmph?     do we need to     we're just... really     put a label on it?     good friends, okay?!     can't we just... see where     things go without thinking about     too much right now?     so, just let it happen     as it happens?     ...alright,     can do that.     good... good.     that's much easier     on my psyche.

0805.jpg
later that night...     i wonder if kat     would be willing     trace and i     to fix this?     should sit out in the     i mean... i know     stars more often.     it's a templar shirt,     even with the     but, i still associate     cold. does help     it with trace.     to destress.     maybe kat could     change the embl     get back herel     huh?     woosh!     maddie?     hah! i've got     you now!     knew this     thing would come     in handy!     you might be     sneaky, but you can't     hide from magicl     slap!     erich

oh! uh...     thanks!     it's not really     a big deal. i couldn't     let you guys die.     it is a big deal!     it's because of us     you were labelled a traitor!     we haven't been very kind     to you in return. yet you're still here     you're a     caring over two human girls.     good person,     sythe.     thanks.     appreciate that,     raine.     though, to be     honest, the choice     c     wasn't as hard as     you might think.     oh?     i an     14     i wasn't exactly     s     thrilled to be on the front     lines acting as fodder in     believe it or not,     the first place.     before all this war nonsense     got started i had my hopes     of being diplomat.     a diplomat?     really?     is that so hard     to believe?     hah! i see     your point.     well... mean, you     must admit, most of the     i guess i don't quite     times i've seen you, you've     been in a loin cloth.     look the part. but i wasn't     always like this!

hey! we're back!     and it worked!     the girls are     washing up now. i think     we're just about ready     to leave this dump.     how's our     "guest" doing?     he's hasn't given     me any trouble.     in fact, he     no004     30000/     30000/     <you know...     ‹hey, relax!     i could have run,     but i didn't!     as i said     <the whole point     before, i have every     of taking this job was so l     you guys really     could afford safe passage     need to learn how     intention of travelling     with you!     to reach my brother.     to tie a rope.     i just saved     but since we're     you the trouble of     all going the same     direction, there's no     that, and keep     untying me!>     need now!>     better track of your     squirrels.›     wha-?!     still think breaking     mrs. nibbly,     no nitrans     free was stupid. they'll     don't     trust you less now.     you traitor!     move!     you'd be surprised.     a little roguish charm can go     a long way towards building     trust in the long run.

many days later...     hey, look!     i can see mountains!     we must be getting close     to the mainland!     eric was right, the     currents made coming     oh, i-it's fine.     back a lot faster.     still, it felt way longer     it doesn't hurt     to me, especially after...     anymore, but i figured     all that's happened.     i'd keep this on.     might help make     me less recognizable     mr'eah...     in the village.     speaking of     which, how's your     i still can't believe     cheek doing?     keith did that!     what a jerk!     he was just upset.     don't blame him.     being scared and angry     is no excuse to start lashing     out at other people!     well i dol     especially     friends!     sigh...     yeah, well, i'm the     last person who can     criticize him for doing     something like that.     i just hope we can find     something to help natani,     for both their sakes.

0839.jpg
you couldn't     help laura, you can't     help natani...     i can't believe     you were once grand     templar. what good     are you now?     you're     …..maybe     uselessl     he's right.     trace, don't say     that! keith was way     out of line!     he's just taking it out on     you because it's how he feels     about himself right now.     he's not wrong     though, is he?     what good     i have power, but it only     have i done?     seems to work when i'm not     thinking about it, and half the     time it's hurting my friends.     ever since waking up     and everyone keeps     all i've managed to do is     telling me the world's falling     put you guys in danger.     apart because of me.     trace... it's not     your fault.     isn't it,     though?     i am the person who     corrupted the templar. i think     facing up to that fact is my best     hope of retaining myself if my     memories ever do return.     but to do that i     need to learn all i can     about who i am.     not being able     to remember doesn't     and that begins     make me innocent.     at edinmire.

alright, natani.     but as     the templar may be     general...     corrupt, but humans are still     we should be landing     technically basitin allies.     soon. kathrin will take care     of you until get back.     you know, at the time l     resented alaric for what he did.     sacrificing himself like that just     to help someone like me.     but now, i'm grateful.     there'd be nothing     i could do for you as     "keith the banished".     what do you think?     pretty good, hm?     i'm sure the other     generals would say this     was an abuse of power,     but i'm not going     but the truth is...     to wallow in self-pity.     not this time.     i've never     been a very good     i know you're     basitin.     still in there, and     i'll get you back.     see you soon.     ...keth.

"back here"?     mmhm.     being back here.     wait, you've been     you know i was     here before?     once a slave.     edinmire is the     closest settlement     to tiger territory.     this... was     my home.     i didn't know that.     why didn't you ever     mention it before?     sigh... i dunno.     it's weird to talk about     those days.     feels like a lifetime ago.     but this place... it looks and smells     exactly how i remember it.     if you followed     this stream a ways, you'd     eventually reach my fath...     my master's farm.     flora, if this is hard for you,     after what happened     you don't have to come with me.     on that island, i'm never     i only plan to look around.     leaving your side again!     nol'     erg! flora...     my spine!

i'm sorry!     are you sure     i said     you're okay?     i'm fine!     though... maybe     really!     someday you could get     those claws trimmed     down just a little?     oh! i actually know     a place for that! and     that's exactly why you     need me with you!     know edinmire     like the stripes on     my tail!     oh. then again,     now that we're back     i'm sorry, flora.     i suppose a trim     if i could just pass as     won't matter.     in human lands, we'll need     i know you hate     to pretend to be servant     human, it wouldn't matter.     but i'll never be able to hide     doing this.     and master again.     what i am completely.     and that means     keeping my claws to     myself anyway.     i recall you mentioning once     that you dreamt of being human.     seeing where you were raised, i'm     starting to understand why.     but listen.     what you are isn't wrong.     i'd never want you to change, not     even the claws, if you don't want to.     we may have to pretend otherwise,     but i love you, stripes and all.     i know.     love you too.     though it's not going     to stay secret for very long if     someone sees us like this.

sigh...     yeah, i think he had     of all the people     his attention elsewhere     to run into, it had     at the time... hmph.     to be keiren.     so who is this     "key" guy?     at least i don't     think he recognized     kei. and...     vou. no one's tailed     it's complicated.     us to the tavem.     he was the son of my old     master. and... my best friend     for a long, long time.     when we were young, the fact     that i was a keidran never seemed     to bother him. in fact, he stood up     for me several times.     but as we got older     kei... changed.     he would act differently     towards me when around his     friends. that's how it started.     it happened slowly, but...     well, to make a long     story short, by the end he was     hunting me when i ran.     i'm sorry, flora. that     must have been hard.     don't trust him. but     aheml     are you two planning to     if he's guard captain now,     stand in my doorway all day     he could help us.     or are you coming in?     either way, i need     to talk to him.     eepl

well, make yourselves     a home. you certainly have     e     your pick of seating.     hey, maeve!     you back there?     need a couple     drinks! sigh... where     is that girl?     ...there's     no one here.     yeah... don't     remind me.     business hasn't     been what it used to be,     ever since we lost our     this is what     main attraction.     the tavern was     but it's     named after.     been particularly     once upon     empty today.     a time this hallway     would take you directly     to our sister tavern     far in the west.     long ago, when     these were keidran lands,     they used walls like these to     "main     avoid humans. ironic.     attraction"?     there are even stories     i'll show     that once, this gate could     you.     lead you to other riftwalls,     in other places.     but ever since     this war business started,     it's gone dark.     don't want to think     about what that might mean     for our sister tavern.     sometimes i think i can see     things moving inside, and hear     whispering at night, but nothing     ever comes through.

man, that archway     gave me the creeps. it felt like     i was being watched when we     were in front of it.     you've never     seen it before?     no. i must have     passed by this tavem loads     of time as a kid, but i never     thought about it.     still, being up here     is a good spot to wait.     stop 1     we'll be able to see kai     coming, just in case he brings     any unwanted company.     still don't like the     idea of waiting this guy.     i think we should     step h     just get what we came for     and leave this weird town     as soon as possible.     trace, i'm still not exactly     clear on how we were planning     oh     staf     on getting to your money.     well...     was going to play it by ear, but basically, i just     planned to get there, scout around a bit - you know,     make sure the coast is clear - then enter the house     undetected through a back window or something,     and make off with everything we need. simple!     i mean it is my property     after all, right? so it's not really     breaking in or stealing.     and i've been gone     for months. why would templar     be guarding an empty building     after all this time?     it's the     perfect plan!     trace, do     you know what     an estate is?

alright! maybe i     wasn't the most well     thought out plan.     i guess i just don't     feel comfortable waiting     around in this place.     feels like we're     being watched.     huh?     don't look now, but     you might be right.     ah... sorry about     all that. my server's     maeve, what are     decided she wants     you doing up there? take     to be shy today.     them the drinks.     mommy!     there's a tiger!     i know there is, dear.     just give it to them.     xxeex     i.. i can't!     sigh...     hold on.     this is my     daughter, maeve.     she's actually     she's not normally like     a fan of tigers, which     this, but we don't serve     might be part of the     many non-humans.     problem.     she's afraid of     her own kind?     oh, not at all. she's just     aw! well,     grown up surrounded by humans,     nice to meet you,     so it's what she's familiar with.     maeve.

what's it like     raising a child in a     oh, not nearly     maybe it's because     human village?     as bad as you we're so far east, but we've     might think.     rarely had much trouble with the     human folk. even after this     war nonsense began.     you always get     the occasional "fleabag"     comment, but i ignore it.     most are decent.     and that's what i try     to teach maeve: look     to the good ones.     that's... a surprising     opinion to hear, especially     from someone who has to     deal with people all day.     is she     your first?     yup! she's     my baby - one     and only.     so cute.     i thought so when     i... i'll be     i first saw you, but i didn't     having my first     want to presume.     soon, too.     is the father     going to be joining     you here, or...?     ah, i see,     congrats!     oh, no,     he's.. well, it's     complicated.     •alen

i don't remember     there being so many     guards in edinmire.     this meeting     is very important.     we're taking every     precaution.     but as long as     you're not wolf, you     don't have anything to     worry about.     eyes forward,     daniels!     but... what about     the wolves that already     live in edinmire?     the servants     and merchants,     like adira?     er, well...     wait, what?! you're locking     at the moment,     up every wolf in the city? even     i canine keidran are     the innocent ones?     being held at the guard     barracks for now.     that's horrible!     flora, it's     not that bad.     this is just a     temporary measure.     the wolves declared war     on us. we can't let our     guard down.     the ones living     here didn't declare     flora, you're     war on anyone!     naive if you think the     wolves here wouldn't     it's not     side with their kind     they can't     right!     in a heartbeat.     change what     they are.

0862.jpg
guards!     kei! what     are you doing?!,     they know!     we need to get     away!     release our     magic!     sir, as i'm sure     use iti     you've overheard, flora     use (t!     is a free keidran.     us c     i don't know how she     us c ;ti     came to be in your possession,     but i won't allow you to keep her     as your servant any longer.     you will be held     until we're sure you're     not a threat to-     pork ra

f-flora?     wha     keiren, tell     your men to     let him. go.     hey! you can't     talk to the captain     that way!     no, it's... it's     alright, daniels. go     back to... whatever     you were doing.     flora, i... i don't     understand. i'm trying,     to help! this guy-     -has done nothing!     something you'd know if you'd     just asked me first.     you haven't changed,     kei. you were always     hey! that's not fair!     deciding for me.     i'm trying to make up for what     i've done. i just didn't know.     so this guy, he's...?     a friend. and i know     how strange that sounds.     it's a long story.     one i don't feel like     telling while your goons     are holding him.     "goons"?     rude.     why is the captain     letting a keidran talk     to him like that?     eh, probably     under orders to play     nice with the stripes     while they're here.     now, if you really want to     make up for before, start by     not arresting my friends.

0864.jpg
sir, we can't     in that case,     detect any mind     let him go.     control.     yes, sir!     we've run     a dispel just     in case.     there, no ham done.     you okay there, pal?     you look a bit sick.     see...     thank you.     i'm... fine.     flora, i... want     to apologize again.     today has been pretty     stressful and this position     is still fairly new to me.     honestly, i was hoping     to impress you be a hero,     ya know, and i guess that...     kinda backfired.     and i suppose i owe     you an apology too.     understand,     kei. thank you.     sorry for the mix-up,     bud. any friend of flora's     is a friend of mine.     just remember,     though...     when it comes to     say, now that i     flora, / came first.     actually get a good     look at you...     you seem...     familiar. what did     you say your name     was. again?

0865.jpg
meanwhile..     sigh...     we're getting     nowhere.     why does every magic     user in this whole village slam     their door in our faces?!     sir, look!     hm? oh...     wow... look     al all the floras.     floras     everywhere..     ...*floras"     sir?     oh, right, you guys     weren't.. erm... would     have been funnier if flora     were here...     f-forget it. let's     see if one of the tigers     might help.

0866.jpg
e-excuse     i- would like to     me... sirs?     apologize for my behaviour     earlier. i may have acted     a bit... rashly.     huh?     these are... difficult     oh, it's you...     times to be trusting, what     apothecary man.     with the war and all.     well, that's...     not my name,     but yes!     but... i... i realize,     as a healer, it is my duty     to aid those in need.     hello!     thus, i feel it is only     right that ... do so.     you'll really     help us?     yes! i... well,     i'll certainly try.     f you could     just lead me to this     wolf of yours...     of course!     follow us, he's     accelerated     heart rate.     nght-     something's     wait,     not.. right. i feel     general.     dilated     we are being     pupils.     deceived.     excessive     perspiration.     don't need all that     to tell something's up.     we're being watched.     huh? what     three humans,     is it, lynn?     at least.

0867.jpg

0868.jpg
believe there's     been a misunderstanding.     we are basitin ambassadors     on a peaceful diplomatic     mission to     tycosyl     do look like the     kind of person who cares     about politics?     that said, we have     nothing against you, rabbit-ears. all     we want is the wolf. hand it over     and we'll be on our way.     lynn, what     am i looking at? ls     that a dragon?     no, i don't     believe so.     emblem of an     adrakist - dragon     worshiper.     many humans consider     dragons a symbol of power.     some are... more fanatical     about it than others.     rest assured     though, despite her     bizzare appearance,     she's still human.     bizza-you     have something     to say about the     way i look?!     oh, no, i quite     like the lizard look, it's     very... unusual.     "lizard"?!

0869.jpg
hey, calm     down, sarah!     maybe you should     let me and landen do     the talking instead?     r-right, lan?     if these guys really     are ambassadors, we might     get in big trouble if we-     cane     and... here     we go again.     mmhm.     ph hi     hys     dink     i may not be a full     dragon yet, but i have     plenty of fire for you!     now tell us where     your wolf is or your     friends will burn!

0876.jpg
"no effect"?     b-but that's     impossible! how?     those pheromones     should work on any man -     keidran or basitin!     on anyone     else, it probably     would have.     i'm.. afraid you just picked     the wrong basitin. you see,     am messenger lynn.     where i am from...     society is divided by     this requires a     gender. but there's.. always     particular kind of person.     need of a go-between.     someone who can be     even during     blind to both.     curfew.     n other words...     let's just say... my     ears don't hang limp like     this for no reason.     still... thank you for     what you said. i'm... not used     to being flirted with. no one on     the island would bother with     someone like me.     even if you     didn't really mean it,     it felt... nice.     well, i mean...     okay, i admit, i was     are... are those     just playing you before.     two seriously having     but, you know...     conversation right     now?/     those ears     of yours really are     kinda cute...

here we are.     shepherd's square.     it's so strange,     seeing tigers interacting     with humans like this.     unlike wolves,     tigers have always     been isolationists.     wait here.     i'm going to find     out what's going on.     flora, are you sure     that's a good idea?     it's fine, trace. these     are my people.     how bizarre, these humans.     i've never seen them so close before.     they really don't have tails? ›     one of my cousins swears     they do! but they always wear     clothes so you can't tell.     we have a bet that she     can get a guard out of his armor     before the first night.     < well, good luck to her.     humans are as prudish as     they are repulsive. ›     erm..     excuse me!:     hm?

0889.jpg
sorry, but if you     don't mind me asking, what     is one of the tribes doing in     human territory?     mean, know you     were invited, but why agree?     aren't you afraid the templar     might try something?     ‹ wha-? accent?     why trust-›     i don't have an-›     snrk... what is     yeah, hear it too!     that accent? ›     she sounds... off. just     bit... human-ish.     < oh, i see. you're a     domesticated keidran.     ‹ what? no! i'm     a natural-born tiger!     i'm not a slave!>     n-not     anymore...     ‹i'm not     a pell!›     hun, your scent reeks     of human. clearly you're     still someone's pet.›     ‹ don't be     < no offense! i think     mean, irist>     it's adorable you still feel     like part of the tribe. hold     on to that, sweetie.     but i'm afraid we don't     have time to humor you.     your masters have     important business with us     real tigers right now. ›     ta-ta!

0890.jpg
tug!     tug!     did you follow     us all the way from     the tavern?     mmhm.     and does your     mom know you're     out here?     maeve?     sniff what are     you doing here?     well, i guess     still, we should     i can't blame you     probably get you back     too much.     to your momma.     used to sneak     off all the time when     was your age.     though it was     miss flora?     usually to the woods,     not town square.     hm?     sheeze     sometimes     people say i sound     human too.     well... there's nothing     wrong with that. don't let     anyone tell you different.

0891.jpg
flora, how did     it go? did they tell     yeah, turns     you why they-     out they weren't     very helpful.     ..uh...     but i ran into     someone else along     the way!     hello.     seems she tried to     tag along - without     momma cat knowing.     oh. well, should     i think we're     we head back to the     better off if we stay     tavern, then?     put for now.     i have a feeling     adira will come looking, and     i don't want us to accidentally     pass each other.     all roads tend to     lead here, so it's the     best place to wait.     hey! looks like you're     say, who's     right, flora. we all ended     the kid?     up in the same place!     oh, this is just     a friend we ran into     along the way.     uh... who     are those two?     same!     sup?

0892.jpg
er... hi, keith.     how's it going with...     what's up     with them?     you-know-what?     do those two     ehm...     not like each other     nothing yet.     or something?     cough..     no, not     at all. it's just...     complicated.     i really shouldn't     say, but you see...     whaaaaa~?l.     oh my goodness!     but they're both...     t-that's so...     so... scandalous!     they're     different…     they were     once lovers.     is that     really true?!     okay…     maybe not.     ...that one did     something stupid, and     it's just a lot     s now too stubborn to     less dumb than the     just apologize.     real reason...     sigh... boys.

0893.jpg
bong!     ladies and gentlemen!     humans and felines!     welcome!     well, looks like     whatever's going on,     it's starting.     wow!     look at all the     floras!     floras     everywhere!     oh my gosh,     maddie!     that's almost     exactly what i said about     basitins and keiths!     you're     hilarious!     hee hee hee!     hee... heh...

0894.jpg
maddie?     something     the matter?     good afternoon.     if i may have     everyone's attention.     i am seer brahn.     i want to thank you,     noble tigers, for accepting     our humble invitation.     and thank you,     good folk of edinmire,     for welcoming them.     know our relationship with     the beast folk has been strained,     but it's important     now more than ever.     to remember that tigers     are not wolves.     and keidran,     like all people, are     not made equal.     so, welcome,     friends.     great.     the templar.     anyone else getting     strange feeling of déjà vu?

0895.jpg
have a bad     feeling about this.     which templar     'ey!     is that?     i know!     that there is brahn, the     master seer one of the grand     templar's five lieutenants.     i've never seen     one in person before.     all five masters are said     to possess a unique magical     gift, and his is supposedly     precognition.     i don't know if i     buy that, though. predicting     the future has always been     a fickle thing.     there are rumors     that he's just a front, and     that his true power comes     from his daughter.     i've heard that, despite     you'd never     being blind, she can see through     know when you're     the eyes of any animal she's     being watched.     come into contact with.     scary     thought.

0896.jpg
ah, there you     are, flora! looks     like i made it.     oh, hello...     again, keiren.     everything alright     oh, sure, just a     back there?     minor scuffle.     not a problem     for the guard!     still, you wouldn't     believe it.     the whole incident was     i - i mean our time-     sparked by couple of those     honored basitin allies!     island weirdos, the...     flora, you know     that guy?     huh? you     mean keith?     yeah, we're friends.     it's... another long story.     oh. well, you know, the     friends of my friend...     i'm not sure i'd     call us friends, kei...     er...     well, seems like you've     had quite the adventure since     leaving the farm...     at least i'm here to see     this one. today should be     hopefully i'll get to hear all     a day to remember.     these "long stories" one day.

thank you,     ah... no     grand templar,     offense.     for my life.     to be honest, it was     not something i would have     expected from someone of     your reputation.     none taken.     you don't seem     that surprised.     oh, i knew     who you were.     i've heard the stories     but like i said back     at the tavern, know     about you, of course, like     when not to pry.     everyone else. but clearly     they can't be all true.     i am one keidran,     at least, who is grateful     you've returned.     i wish i had money to repay     you. but if my tavern still stands,     you'll always be welcome.     licki     oh, thanks!     but there's really     no need to-     see you around,     mr. trace.

what... was     she was just     that all about?     showing gratitude.     oh! alright. heh.     in our way.     for a second there,     she's a     i thought she was... uh...     keidran.     propositioning me.     well, like     said, she's     a keidran.     i can't     believe it..     that runt who was     with flora... was the     i only ever saw     grand templar?!     him the once, before he     became a recluse.     and flora's just     casually talking with him!     she even hugged him!     doesn't that girl     realize who he is?     wait a minute... he's     trace. the same trace who     a position he still     sirl     owns the legacy estate.     holds. and that means he's     technically my boss.     his estate is here     because he also held the     title of duke of edinmire.     you need     to see this!     t's the templar     miss reni took out.     a boss i tried     to have arrested     earlier today!     what is     it now?

0914.jpg
is that-?!     i knew it! i knew     it's a wolfl     there was something     more to this!     those rotten     fleabags!     i knew the templar     wouldn't do this! this was     a setup from the start!     dressing up a     templar and attacking     the tigers while framing     us in the process!     bastards!     we need to move!     there's still at least two,     warden tallon,     probably more- huh?     captain!     reporting!     we're the     reenforcements     you sent for!     i sent for?     wha-?     wait, from...?     relief units-?     the wolfpens.     what are you talking     about? i never sent any     relief units to...     the relief units you sent     said you needed every able-     bodied soldier here. we were     told you'd been overun!     .. the wolfpens!

0915.jpg
all the wolves rounded     up in the southeast are being     held in the wolfpens!     who     are you?/     if they break them     out... we're going to have     are you one     a war on our hands!     of them? show     your facel     that's not     the worst of it,     captain!     captain, get     ahold of yourself!     it's lt. reed!     fires are still spreading     fires have     toward the harbour. we have     also started up all     to do something, or edinmire     over the city!     will be left crippled.     so what do we do?     do we go after the wolves?     the docks? the city?     we can answer     questions later.     let's get out     of here while he's     captain! what'     distracted.     right!     should we do?     we will fight.     we may be     keidran, but we     are tigers first.     i hold no love     for humans, but i will     defend my people.     er, you?     but... you're...     as will i. the     templar cannot allow     these filthy imposters to     soil our good name.

what the hell     is going on?     bas     how is there a     younger version of me     if you mean     in my own head?     stuck in your head,     then no.     who are you?     i'm pretty sure having     zen's mental crutch swept out     from under us did that.     are you the     reason i'm stuck     like this?     if you mean stuck     looking like your normal     bosomy self...     ...i'm guessing it's     because of how you     feel right now.     do not feel     ...and bam/ you're     like a woman!     stuck with your... bountiful     womanliness.     no, but without zen     we're feeling pretty weak.     and you consider     woman and weakness     in the same breath.     sooo, your mind     just falls back on     what it knows...

0917.jpg
here, give me     i don't need     your hand-     to be mocked by my     own imagination.     and i'm not buying it.     zen is here somewhere, i     know it. i just have to find     him and wake up!     keep away     from mel     hey,     wait!     come back!     tss!!     porn on a an 1 pe     zen?     zen?!     zent

0918.jpg
i knew it!     knew you still     had to be here!     hey, ze!     wumpio     yeow!     oh, wait...     no it didn't. none     of this is real.     that hurt!     but what the     you know, i love zen too,     hell is this?!     but it's kinda weird to want him     inside our head so badly.     like i said,     we're cut off.     but maybe     i... can help?     hint, hint.

0919.jpg
don't you     "hint hint" me!     i'm not an idiot, okay?     i know what you are, see     where this is all going. but     i won't play along!     i refuse!     refuse to let     myself...     to let myself     be you again.     natani.     sup     look... i get it.     you see accepting me     that somehow this     as losing yourself.     is going to end with you in a     dress embracing all things     girly or something.     you think of your     younger self as the scared     little girl zen's link saved     you from being.     but none of that is true.     ..as a big brother protecting     you remember yourself that     the only family he had left.     way, because it's how zen     remembered you.     don't blame     zen! he didn't see     me as weak.     he saw us     the only way     he could...     a part of him will always think of us as his helpless     baby sister. and the link bumed that into your mind.

0920.jpg
are you saying     that i remember     myself wrong?     probably more     than you realize.     a lot of blanks had     to be filled in after our     mind was shattered.     i know you blame me for     all the feelings you associate     with being a woman.     but truthfully, i don't     think we're as different     as you believe.     natani, i didn't     cut my hair and dress     like a boy just to join     zen in the guild.     secretly…     liked it.     what do     you mean?     mean, i didn't mind     being a girl, but... liked     being seen as a boy.     what? i disguised     no, that's just     myself because i was     how zen saw it! i     desperate! i had to!     never told him.     don't you see?     you're always giving zen so     much credit for making you     who you are now.     but the way you     see yourself... the feelings you     have, both masculine and, yes,     occasionally feminine...     .it all comes from you.

0921.jpg
always assumed     it was all zen. that being     myself might have me go     back to... you know.     yes. and think     that fear is what's kept     you trapped here.     you don't need     zen to make you     who you are.     that's not to say     what you experienced with     zen was not real.     the link will always be     a part of us. and the damage     i just hoped to     to our mind, likewise, will never     remind you of that.     be completely healed.     where you came     from, and...     but the choices you made     ..how to     and how you chose to act     stand up on your     on it... that was you.     own again.     i... i get it. i'm still not sure how     i feel about you. but... you are a     part of me. and you're right.     ...and because if     we don't, i suspect we'll     i need to start     end up burning to death     relying on myself.     pretty soon.     wait, what?     i'm glad.     because this is the     way it should be.

0947.jpg
ehem.     i apologize.     it seems you     are indeed who you     claim to be.     though the     circumstances are not     quite expected.     nevertheless,     lady nora vouches for     grrarg..     you, then that is good     enough for me.     if you wish, i can     thank you.     in to fill you in later on     anything you need.     it's been a long     day. i suspect you     but for now...     and your... uh...     may i please have     ..companions     your permission to rest     feel the same.     here in your home for     the time being?     oh, uh...     sure, i guess.     ‹guess     ah, speaking     this is it. hm.     of which...     well, this place     not a bad place to     it looks like the     sure beats the pants     rest of them have     off my manor.     get imprisoned.›     finally arrived.     suggest     we take this     inside.     erg... kinda     regret saving this     stuff now.     ‹oh, great,     another giant     lizard.>

0948.jpg
chunk!     creeeeeki     so, uh...     ah, master. i see     you've finally returned...     do we...     quite a lot later than     knock, or...?     scheduled.     i'd heard you'd died.     what a shame.     it's a     wolf!     guardswoman, if     you find me threatening,     i weep for edinmire.     ah'm rose- er, / am     roselyn, the seneschal     of this residence.     all domestic     wolves were     well, come in,     relocated!     it's cold out there.     i'll make tea.     how is it you     were not taken with     the other wolves?!     if your guards     think they could take me     from this place, i would be     very impressed.

0949.jpg
it's one fad     actually do     appreciate.     this entrance     is huge!     / can't even count the     number of times i've hit my     head on a door frame.     as i said,     dragon-sized.     it's been a fad     among nobles to be able to     ..seven.     host such guests, no matter     how unlikely that is.     well, should     ... though in your     be plenty of guest     case, suppose it's     rooms. after today,     more legitimate.     i'm exhausted.     woah, hey     now! that wasn't     no one is going     part of the deal.     in the dungeons.     this is my house     the arrangement was:     (apparently) and therefore     we allow you to stay here,     they are my guests.     if you and your wolf friend     stay in the dungeons.     remember?     but captain     keiren said !     ms. reed,     plop!     it's okay.     i know for a fact now     they have no connection     to the city attacks.     the wolf     from before!     and i can keep     my eyes on everyone     it's alive?     regardless of where     they are.     yes, i made     sure of it.     cucy!     though you are     mistaken, trace.     once he is secured,     hope to leam more about     the dungeons here     what's behind this attack.     will still see use.

0950.jpg
thank you.     trace, listen. i...     ...again.     i want to say i'm sorry     for how i acted before     we left the ship.     after natani     collapsed, i just... was     lashing out. i didn't know     of course.     what to do.     you guys are     i shouldn't have blamed     my friends. i'd never     you for not being able to help.     let anyone go to the     i certainly shouldn't have hit     dungeons.     you because of that.     so, i... l'm     tracel     there!     wimp!     even.     ...ow?     that's the     basitin way to     do it, right?     ...heh... eheh...     ah-heheheh!     ugh...     boys.     ‹okay, what     did i miss?     keith laughing     is unnatural.›

0951.jpg
so...     anyone else     find it odd that trace     has a keidran for a     don't seem     seneschal?     weird to me.     i mean, no     rich humans     offense, trace.     and keidran servants     go hand-in-hand in my     but we all know     experience.     how you were with     keidran - especially     who better to     wolves.     lord over?     yes, but trace     is... was a rather     extreme case.     and why would     he have a portrait     of her here?     something     strange about     this place...     .. though i must admit,     i'd like to     rose was pretty cute,     think i still am, but     once upon a time.     thank you.     eeeekl     to answer your     question, i didn't belong     to master trace.     i belonged     to her.     she employed     me, and had me     painted.     she's the reason     the painting and i     are still here.     saria...

0952.jpg
ngh...     are you okay?     more memories?     damn them.     trace?     ah?     eh, no, just...     emotions this time.     i'm alright.     are you     sure?     yeah. with     you am, flora.     ‹man... so     though, maybe     much gold.     we should skip the tea.     i'm really     i'd like to lie down.     tempted to pocket     some of this stuff.>     uh.... very     well, master.     your bedroom     prepared as     ‹..huh. snow     always.     wolves usually all look     the same to me, but the     one in this painting looks     oddly... familiar.›     on second     thought, maybe     i shouldn't.     ‹you two     know each     other?>     uh, erm...     ‹it's nothing.     snow wolves and     forest wolves just don't     get along, is all.› is

the legacy estate     has never hosted quite     such a... diverse group     of guests before.     am aware basitins in     particular have requirements     when it comes to sleeping     arrangements.     but i assure     you, there's plenty     distribute     of space.     yourselves as     we have two wings     you see fit.     on this floor, so male basitins     please note,     may take one separately i     the third floor     they so desire.     is off limits.     ‹ hey!     hear that?     ‹or even the     looks like we're     same wingl>     finally staying somewhere     where you two won't have to     share the same room!>     ‹oh...     great.›     <y-yeah.     good. finally.›     <b-but you know,     after what happened     ..okay.     with natani...›     ‹oh, yeah!     i'm not nearly     100% yet...›     ‹just to be safe,     «we have adjoining     i should procobably     rooms in the east wing, if...     be nearby...›     that's what you desire.     ‹yes!     safety!>     feel free to call for me     if you need anything else.     otherwise, good night.›

ehem...     [ i hate to.. be the     [ natani's my     one to bring this up...     friend. after everything     however, basitin law is     that's happened... i just     dear about this: you cannot remain     want to spend some     in a room overnight with... someone     time together!     of the opposite sex. j     like i would with any     other guy! it's not fair that     i can't do that just because     of... how they look! 1     wha-?     [i know it doesn't seem     [ b-but natani's     fair. but now that you're a     basitin citizen again- ]     not... er... we've never...     it's not like that! ]     [ but we're not     even on the island     anymore! ]     [ yes. but nevertheless,     you are our ambassador.     you, more than     anyone, represent our     people to the world. j     [i never asked     o be that! the basitins     on the island don't even     want me to be that! ]     [ well i'm sticking     [ unfortunately, for     with natani.     many, what we are is not     a choice we make.     we're stuck with     the cards life has     dealt us.     [ besides, like     roselyn said, it's an     adjoining room.     technically two rooms.     so no laws are going to     be broken tonight.     [ of course, sir.     ...if you say so.

back at the legacy estate...     - sage     though i admit     ah- it's nice to have some     i have been shedding     fresh clothes again. ones that     quite a lot lately.     don't smell like seawater.     not sure if it's     ...and aren't     stress, the baby, or     completely covered     just my winter coat     in tiger fur!     coming in.     thibt!     love you too,     either way,     trace. i'll make sure     i could use bath.     i spreads to those     and maybe a nice     soon enough!     grooming.     i'm sure both     oh, speaking     of those things can     of roselyn, are we still     be arranged.     going to try and keep...     us a secret?     we can ask that     seneschal wolf.     after breakfast,     i don't think     of course!     there's much point.     the dragon knows.     and if roselyn hasn't     guessed already, i'm sure     she will soon enough.     true. we spent     the night in the same room     and we're covered in each     putting what     together?     other's scents.     it's pretty obvious.     still, probably shouldn't     mention the baby.     i doubt she'd even     believe it, but just in case,     it's best if rose doesn't end     up putting it together.     mrrreow!!!

0977.jpg
what's     the matter,     oh... i'm not much     reni?     of a morning dragon.     since dawn, i've     been in the dungeon trying     to get information out of the     wolf we captured.     is that coffee? oh,     bless you, ma'ami     why don't you     just read his mind     like you did me?     that's what i've     been doing. it's all i can do,     since he's still yet to regain     consciousness.     i've managed to     see how they infiltrated     so far, from what     the city, and when they     can tell, the wolf we     planned their attack.     have now was just a     pawn in all this.     what's been so     aggravating is trying to find     who his boss is. who's really     behind the attack?     the wolf     w-well... that's just     didn't know?     it, i'm not sure.     i can see anything     he's experienced, but     the problem is...     well... it's     little embarrassing     to admit, but...     uh...     i don't     understand     keidran.

0978.jpg
‹hey,     hang on!>     oh, hello.     you are the other     wolf... uh...     oh, right. yes.     <n-natani.     we dragons "speak"     and what do you mean     telepathically.     you can't speak keidran? i can     it's universal. you hear     understand you right now!>     my intentions, and as you speak     words, i can hear yours.     i have leamed human.     but even for me, speaking     grash itsh griahl     this way is a necessity.     rwar arr rawrrawrararl     am limited by my biology     just as any creature. if i were to     try and speak human out loud     okay, we     in this form, it'd be... well...     get it!     ehem...     ...sorry. a-anyway, a lot of     dragons just rely on telepathy.     but as i've discovered,     the flaw with telepathy is that     it only works in real time.     the people in a memory aren't real.     they don't have minds for me to read.     that being said, after     even the wolf whose mind i'm in doesn't translate.     listening for a while, one name     people remember their past but not exactly what     does come up repeatedly.     they were thinking at any given time, usually.     a name / believe     may be of importance     in all of this...     au hear are sounds.     it's frustrating and honestly pretty     unnerving to suddenly not understand     clovis.     the sounds that people are making.

0979.jpg
"clovis"?     who the hell is that?     ‹he's the only guy i can     another assassin?     think of who might have sent     this little twit after me.     but no. clovis isn't an     assassin. he's worse.:     worse than an     assassin? what's     in human,     worse than that?     pleasel     a rich asshole!     one . ..emm.. used to     ‹owe money> to.     he's... well, he     likes to call himself the     so... you     < prince of greed.›     owe this clovis     he uses his gold     your life?     to force.. ‹desperate>     to work for him.     ‹eugh! don't     remind me.     the.. mind link i told     the thought of that     you about, between me     slimy bastard poking     and my brother-     around in my head...›     supposed     link.     and you say you     did jobs for him?     -he helped     create it.     ‹not by choice!›     ‹and before you ask, no,     i don't work for him anymore, or know     what he's up to now. we haven't     crossed paths in years.     in fact, last i heard, he     pretty much up and disappeared.     odd, considering how much of a     playboy he was. i'd hoped he'd     and that     means trouble...     been offed by somebody.     but i can tell you if he is     here, it's only because he has     something to gain.›

<i am disappointed     ‹aw, i'm sure clovey     that your little sibling     will be pleased you still     isn't here with you.     remember him!›     don't worry, though,     we'll catch that one too.     and believe me...     ‹clovis has     special plans     for her.›     <i won't let any of     the shackle!     you lay a hand on natani,     you son of a bitch!›     billu!     cracke     ‹what     the-?>     i... i think it's     trying to nullify     the magic!     ‹ a magic suppressor?     well isn't that just bloody     inconvenient.     still, it'll take you ages     to get through like that. and     i could just keep refreshing     this barrier all day...›     < but i think it's time to     stop fooling around and     wrap this up already!>

so... new     dragon, huh?     where'd the     white one go?     capi.*     lap!     you two were     practically joined at     the hip for as long as     i've known you.     wait, "reni"?     that's the dragon     princess?     uh, yeah?     i guess. you     know her?     of course     i know her!     oh, nora is... well,     mean, not personally.     it's a long story. i have a     but everyone knows about     feeling she'll be back.     the royal dragons.     this is reni. we     what's someone     met in edinmire.     like that doing out here     in the boonies?     so she     is royalty?     i didn't even know     dragons had a system     of govemment.     say, reni, does     that mean nora takes     orders from you?     oops...     op fff!     sorry...     what?!

1002.jpg
so... you     don't have authority     "dragon princess"     over her?     is not a dragon title.     it's a title given     merciful     to me by humans.     nora! no!     wahl     you were     i can't speak for     correct earlier.     all dragons, but most     there is     i've met prefer to live     no formal dragon     by their own rules.     govemment.     so, no, i do not have     any power over nora,     or most other dragon     for that matter.     in fact, if there     even if she doesn't     were any dragon who could     exactly act her age     demand authority over others,     half the time.     it would be her.     the one thing almost all     dragons respect is seniority.     unlike humans, dragons only     grow stronger with age.     don't     tell her i sald     that!     and nana nora     is... very old.     huh...     nora always     seemed to act very     oh, well... er, yes,     casual around me.     technically. i think she's my...     great great grandmother?     though... that's not     you're lucky,     saying very much. most dragons     then. she can     be intense.     claim to trace their lineage back to     her, one way or another.     you called     but suffice it to say,     her "nana."     when it comes to rank, am     near the very bottom. at least,     are you two     by dragon standards.     related?

ms reni!     you're the first dragon     what's it     like?!     i've ever been able to     uh...     meet up close!     yeah, it's-     i'm karen!     what's...     i think dragons     what like?     are so cool!     boop!     oh! uh...     being     thank you?     a dragon!     -nice,     i suppose?     those are     it must be     some strange     awesome!     i've... only ever     ears…     been a dragon, so     don't know...     and honestly,     i'm probably not     i was raised     erm... well...     the best dragon     almost exclusively     you see... many, many     to ask.     among humans.     human generations ago,     the only other     my grandfather...     dragon i know well is     he... uh... met     my mother, the former     a human woman. and...     "dragon princess".     she happened to be the     daughter of the human     we're both     king at the time.     considered anomalies     among dragons.     and... well...     one thing led to     another...     so why is that?     wait... are     what started the whole     you saying dragons     royal dragon thing?     and humans can...     reproduce?     y-yeah, i know!     weird, right? haha!     no, i mean     60701 o     physically, how?     or idol o     but... how?     if she was a human     and he was a dragon, how     w-well, when it comes to     would she even...     partners, dragons are pretty flexible,     and they don't care what the masks     have to say about it.     / don't know! / assume     it's definitely not     magic was involved, but she     common, though!     was my grandmother, i don't     want to think about it!

ah! here, sir-     gate key.     it's a lot     smaller than     trace.     it will open a     reni's.     doorway back to the     trace...     gate in the garden from     you should hold     wherever you are.     on to this.     they're     not normally     that large.     keep in mind,     the gate only opens     for you, and only for     a limited time.     the estate is     after which, it takes     protected by many     long time to recharge.     enchantments and     so i suggest saving it for     dragon magic.     an emergency.     it is one of the     safest places in the     world to be...     thanks, rose. i     can see how this might     come in handy...     but..?     ..but your former     ...how safe     associates are quite     are we here?     crafty and insidious.     i fear nothing will     stop them from eventually     well...     finding a way in, or drawing     you out, given time.     that's what     someone is     i figured.     i think flora     noi where they     and i should have the     should bel     ceremony as soon as     we can, then     rose? are     huh? what     you okay?     do you mean? how     do you know?

"it's trying to     get out... "it was     the wolf."     you act as     though it's your wolf     daunte     form itself that you're     fighting against... as     if it were alive.     b02c au:: pudde     it does kinda     feel that way     shop e dals     sometimes...     your keidran shape     is just that: a shape, an     but it's not.     ability, a skill that requires     training like any other.     but i do think the     first step is to conquer this     subconscious wolf you've     made in your mind.     here…     if you're truly     willing, wear this.     ahl     are you out     aunzaer trelya     of your mind,     old wolf?!     why would     i ever wear one     of these?!     okay…     what is it?     because…     it only works on     keidran.     as a human, it     shouldn't have any     effect on you at all.     it's :     but if it does, well...     templar slave     i guess you'll have no     collar.     choice but to overcome the     wolf and change back,     now won't you?

1115.png
no, wait!     the ceiling!     it's flat, but it has no     columns. it's probably held up     by supports from the roof above.     if so, there's no way it's as thick     and heavy as these walls.     at least     i... i think...     look!     there!     that's not     a star!     it's a hole!     that must be from     when natani's magic     got deflected!     grrfacka     shoof!     slam/
